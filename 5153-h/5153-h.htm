      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Howrah City bows the knee
    More or less to masters three,
            King, and Prince, and Siva.
    Howrah City pays in pain
    Taxes which the royal twain
    Give to priests, to give again
            (More or less) to Siva.
</pre>
    <p>
      THAT was no time or place for any girl of twenty to be wandering
      unprotected. Rosemary McClean knew it; the old woman, of the sweeper
      caste, that is no caste at all,&mdash;the hag with the flat breasts and
      wrinkled skin, who followed her dogwise, and was no more protection than a
      toothless dog,&mdash;knew it well, and growled about it in incessant
      undertones that met with neither comment nor response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave a pearl of price to glisten on the street, yes!&rdquo; she grumbled.
      &ldquo;Perhaps none might notice it&mdash;perhaps! But her&mdash;here&mdash;at
      this time&mdash;&rdquo; She would continue in a rumbling growl of half-prophetic
      catalogues of evil&mdash;some that she had seen to happen, some that she
      imagined, and not any part of which was in the least improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girl passed through the stenching, many-hued bazaar, the roar would
      cease for a second and then rise again. Turbaned and pugreed&mdash;Mohammedan
      and Hindoo&mdash;men of all grades of color, language, and belief, but
      with only one theory on women, would stare first at the pony that she
      rode, then at her, and then at the ancient grandmother who trotted in her
      wake. Low jests would greet the grandmother, and then the trading and the
      gambling would resume, together with the under-thread of restlessness that
      was so evidently there and yet so hard to lay a finger on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun beat down pitilessly&mdash;brass&mdash;like the din of cymbals.
      Beneath the sun helmet that sat so squarely and straightforwardly on the
      tidy chestnut curls, her face was pale. She smiled as she guided her pony
      in and out amid the roaring throng, and carefully refused to see the
      scowls, her brave little shoulders seconded a pair of quiet, brave gray
      eyes in showing an unconquerable courage to the world, and her clean, neat
      cotton riding-habit gave the lie and the laugh in one to poverty; but, as
      the crowd had its atmosphere of secret murmuring, she had another of
      secret anxiety.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Neither had fear. She did not believe in it. She was there to help her
father fight inhuman wrong, and die, if need be, in the last ditch. T
 a two-hundred-million crowd, held down and compelled by less than a
hundred thousand aliens. And, least of all, had the man who followed
her at a little distance the slightest sense of fear. He was far more
conversant with it than she, but&mdash;unlike her, and far more than the
seething crowd&mdash;he knew the trend of events, and just what likelihood
there was of insult or injury to Rosemary McClean being avenged in a
generation.
</pre>
    <p>
      He caused more comment than she, and of a different kind. His rose-pink
      pugree, with the egret and the diamond brooch to hold the egret in its
      place&mdash;his jeweled sabre&mdash;his swaggering, almost ruffianly air&mdash;were
      no more meant to escape attention than his charger that clattered and
      kicked among the crowd, or his following, who cleared a way for him with
      the butt ends of their lances. He rode ahead, but every other minute a
      mounted sepoy would reach out past him and drive his lance-end into the
      ribs of some one in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would follow much deep salaaming; more than one head would bow very
      low indeed; and in many languages, by the names of many gods, he would be
      cursed in undertones. Aloud, they would bless him and call him
      &ldquo;Heaven-born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he took no interest whatever in the crowd. His dark-brown eyes were
      fixed incessantly on Rosemary McClean's back. Whenever she turned a corner
      in the crowded maze of streets, he would spur on in a hurry until she was
      in sight again, and then his handsome, swarthy face would light with
      pleasure&mdash;wicked pleasure&mdash;self-assertive, certain, cruel. He
      would rein in again to let her draw once more ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary McClean knew quite well who was following her, and knew, too,
      that she could do nothing to prevent him. Once, as she passed a species of
      caravansary&mdash;low-roofed, divided into many lockable partitions, and
      packed tight with babbling humanity&mdash;she caught sight of a pair of
      long, black thigh boots, silver-spurred, and of a polished scabbard that
      moved spasmodically, as though its owner were impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo; she muttered to herself. &ldquo;I wonder whether he would come
      to my assistance if I needed him. He fought once&mdash;or so he says&mdash;for
      the British; he might be loyal still. I wonder what he is doing here, and
      what&mdash;Oh, I wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was very careful not to seem to look sideways, or seek acquaintance
      with the wearer of the boots; had she done so, she would have gained
      nothing, for the moment that he caught sight of her through the opened
      door he drew back into a shadow, and swore lustily. What he said to
      himself would have been little comfort to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the breath of God!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;These preachers of new creeds are the
      last straw, if one were wanting! They choose the one soft place where
      Mohammedan and Hindoo think alike, and smite! If I wanted to raise hell
      from end to end of Hind, I too would preach a new creed, and turn
      good-looking women loose to wander on the country-side!&mdash;Ah!&rdquo; He drew
      back even further, as he spied the egret and the sabre and the stallion
      cavorting down the street&mdash;then thought better of it and strode
      swaggering to the doorway, and stood, crimson-coated, in the sunlight,
      stroking upward insolently at his black, fierce-barbered beard. There was
      a row of medal ribbons on his left breast that bore out something at least
      of his contention; he had been loyal to the British once, whether he was
      so now or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the charger eyed him sideways and passed on. Mahommed Gunga
      waited. One of the prince's followers rode close to him&mdash;leaned low
      from the saddle&mdash;and leered into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowest not enough to salute thy betters?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga made a movement with his right hand in the direction of his
      left hip&mdash;one that needed no explanation; the other legged his horse
      away, and rode on, grinning nastily. To reassure himself of his
      superiority over everybody but his master, he spun his horse presently so
      that its rump struck against a tented stall, and upset tent and goods.
      Then he spent two full minutes in outrageous execration of the men who
      struggled underneath the gaudy cloth, before cantering away, looking,
      feeling, riding like a fearless man again. Mahommed Gunga sneered after
      him, and spat, and turned his back on the sunshine and the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a mind to teach that Hindoo who his betters are!&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, risaldar-sahib!&rdquo; said a voice persuasively. &ldquo;By your own showing
      the hour is not yet&mdash;why spill blood before the hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput swaggered to the dark door, spurs jingling, looking back across
      his shoulder once or twice, as though he half-regretted leaving the Hindoo
      horseman's head upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, sahib,&rdquo; advised the voice again. &ldquo;They be many. We are few. And,
      who knows&mdash;our roads may lie together yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga kicked his scabbard clear, and strode through the door. The
      shadows inside and the hum of voices swallowed him as though he were a
      big, red, black-legged devil reassimilated in the brewing broth of
      trouble; but his voice boomed deep and loud after he had disappeared from
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When their road and my road lie together, we will travel all feet
      foremost!&rdquo; he asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten turnings further away by that time, Rosemary McClean pressed on
      through the hot, dinning swarm of humanity, missing no opportunity to slip
      her pony through an opening, but trying, too, to seem unaware that she was
      followed. She chose narrow, winding ways, where the awnings almost met
      above the middle of the street, and where a cavalcade of horsemen would
      not be likely to follow her&mdash;only to hear a roar behind her, as the
      prince's escort started slashing at the awnings with their swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rush and a din of shouting beside her and ahead, as the
      frightened merchants scurried to pull down their awnings before the
      ruthless horse-men could ride down on them; the narrow street transformed
      itself almost on the instant into a undraped, cleared defile between two
      walls. And after that she kept to the broader streets, where there was
      room in the middle for a troop to follow, four abreast, should it choose.
      She had no mind to seek her own safety at the expense of men whose souls
      her father was laboring so hard to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got no credit, though, for consideration&mdash;only blame for what the
      swordsmen had already done. One man&mdash;a Maharati trader&mdash;half-naked,
      his black hair coiled into a shaggy rope and twisted up above his neck&mdash;followed
      her, side-tracking through the mazy byways of the bewildering mart, and
      coming out ahead of her&mdash;or lurking beside bales of merchandise and
      waiting his opportunity to leap from shadow into shadow unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her until she reached the open, where a double row of trees on
      each side marked the edge of a big square, large enough for the drilling
      of an army. Along one side of the square there ran the high brick wall,
      topped with a kind of battlement, that guarded the Maharajah's palace
      grounds from the eyes of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she turned, just as she was starting to canter her pony beside the
      long wall, he leaped out at her and seized her reins. The old woman
      screamed, and ran to the wall and cowered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very likely the man only meant to frighten her and heap insults on her,
      for in '56, though wrath ran deep and strong, men waited. There was to be
      sudden, swift whelming when the time came, not intermittent outrage. But
      he had no time to do more than rein her pony back onto its haunches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a clatter of scurrying hoofs behind, and from a whirl of dust,
      topped by a rose-pink pugree, a steel blade swooped down on her and him. A
      surge of brown and pink and cream, and a dozen rainbow tints flashed past
      her; a long boot brushed her saddle on the off side. There was a sickening
      sound, as something hard swished and whicked home; her pony reeled from
      the shock of a horse's shoulder, and&mdash;none too gently&mdash;none too
      modestly&mdash;the prince with the egret and the handsome face reined in
      on his horse's haunches and saluted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was blood, becoming dull-brown in the dust between them. He shook
      his sabre, and the blood dripped from it then he held it outstretched, and
      a horseman wiped it, before he returned it with a clang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sahiba's servant!&rdquo; he said magnificently, making no motion to let her
      pass, but twisting with his sword-hand at his waxed mustache and smiling
      darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down between them at the thing that but a minute since had
      lived, and loved perhaps as well as hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you, Jaimihr-sahib!&rdquo; she said, shuddering. A year ago she would
      have fallen from her pony in a swoon, but one year of Howrah and its daily
      horrors had so hardened her that she could look and loathe without the
      saving grace of losing consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shame would have been easier to realize, had I taken more than one
      stroke!&rdquo; he answered irritably, still blocking the way on his great horse,
      still twisting at his mustache point, still looking down at her through
      eyes that blazed a dozen accumulated centuries' store of lawless ambition.
      He was proud of that back-handed swipe of his that would cleave a man each
      time at one blow from shoulder-joint to ribs, severing the backbone. A
      woman of his own race would have been singing songs in praise of him and
      his skill in swordsman-ship already; but no woman of his own race would
      have looked him in the eye like that and dared him, nor have done what she
      did next. She leaned over and swished his charger with her little whip,
      and slipped past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore, deep and fiercely, as he spurred and wheeled, and cantered after
      her. His great stallion could overhaul her pony in a minute, going stride
      for stride; the wall was more than two miles long with no break in it
      other than locked gates; there was no hurry. He watched her through
      half-closed, glowering, appraising eyes as he cantered in her wake,
      admiring the frail, slight figure in the gray cotton habit, and bridling
      his desire to make her&mdash;seize her reins, and halt, and make her&mdash;admit
      him master of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached her stirrup, she reined in and faced him, after a hurried
      glance that told her her duenna had failed her. The old woman was
      invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave that body to lie there in the dust and sun?&rdquo; she asked
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no vulture, or jackal, or hyena, sahiba!&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I do not eat
      carrion!&rdquo; He seemed to think that that was a very good retort, for he
      showed his wonderful white teeth until his handsome face was the epitome
      of self-satisfied amusement. His horse blocked the way again, and all
      retreat was cut off, for his escort were behind her, and three of them had
      ridden to the right, outside the row of trees, to cut off possible escape
      in that direction. &ldquo;Was it not well that I was near, sahiba? Would it have
      been better to die at the hands of a Maharati of no caste&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than to see blood spilt&mdash;than to be beholden to a murderer?
      Infinitely better! There was no need to kill that man&mdash;I could have
      quieted him. Let me pass, please, Jaimihr-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reined aside; but if she thought that cold scorn or hot anger would
      either of them quell his ardor, she had things reversed. The less she
      behaved as a native woman would have done&mdash;the more she flouted him&mdash;the
      more enthusiastic he became.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba!&rdquo;&mdash;he trotted beside her, his great horse keeping up easily
      with her pony's canter&mdash;&ldquo;I have told you oftener than once that I
      make a good friend and a bad enemy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have answered oftener than once that I do not need your friendship,
      and am not afraid of you! You forget that the British Government will hold
      your royal brother liable for my safety and my father's!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, overlook certain things, sahiba.&rdquo; He spoke evenly, with a
      little space between each word. With the dark look that accompanied it,
      with the blood barely dry yet on the dusty road behind, his speech was not
      calculated to reassure a slip of a girl, gray-eyed or not, stiff-chinned
      or not, borne up or not by Scots enthusiasm for a cause. &ldquo;This is a native
      state. My brother rules. The British&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are near enough, and strong enough, to strike and to bring you and your
      brother to your knees if you harm a British woman!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You
      forget&mdash;when the British Government gives leave to missionaries to go
      into a native state, it backs them up with a strong arm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You build too much on the British and my brother, sahiba! Listen&mdash;Howrah
      is as strong as I am, and no stronger. Had he been stronger, he would have
      slain me long ago. The British are&mdash;&rdquo; He checked himself and trotted
      beside her in silence for a minute. She affected complete indifference; it
      was as though she had not heard him; if she could not be rid of him, she
      at least knew how to show him his utter unimportance in her estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard, sahiba, of the Howrah treasure? Of the rubies? Of the
      pearls? Of the emeralds? Of the bars of gold? It is foolishness, of
      course; we who are modern-minded see the crime of hoarding all that
      wealth, and adding to it, for twenty generations. Have you heard of it,
      sahiba?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered savagely, swishing at his charger again to make him
      keep his distance. &ldquo;You have told me of it twice. You have told me that
      you know where it is, and you have offered to show it to me. You have told
      me that you and your brother Maharajah Howrah and the priests of Siva are
      the only men who know where it is, and you lust for that treasure! I can
      see you lust! You think that I lust too, and you make a great mistake
      Jaimihr-sahib! You see, I remember what you have told me. Now, go away and
      remember what I tell you. I care for you and for your treasure exactly
      that!&rdquo; She hit his charger with all her might, and at the sting of the
      little whip he shied clear of the road before the Rajah's brother could
      rein him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again her effort to destroy his admiration for her had directly the
      opposite effect. He swore, and he swore vengeance; but he swore, too, that
      there was no woman in the East so worth a prince's while as this one, who
      dared flout him with her riding-whip before his men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba!&rdquo; he said, sidling close to her again, and bowing in the saddle in
      mock cavalier humility. &ldquo;The time will come when your government and my
      brother, who&mdash;at present&mdash;is Maharajah Howrah&mdash;will be of
      little service to you. Then, perhaps, you may care to recall my promise to
      load all the jewels you can choose out of the treasure-house on you. Then,
      perhaps, you may, remember that I said 'a throne is better than a grave,
      sahiba.' Or else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else what, Jaimihr-sahib?&rdquo; She reined again and wheeled about and
      faced him&mdash;pale-trembling a little&mdash;looking very small and frail
      beside him on his great war-horse, but not flinching under his gaze for a
      single second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else, sahiba&mdash;I think you saw me slay the Maharati? Do you think
      that I would stop at anything to accomplish what I had set out to do? See,
      sahiba&mdash;there is a little blood there on your jacket! Let that be for
      a pledge between us&mdash;for a sign&mdash;or a token of my oath that on
      the day I am Maharajah Howrah, you are Maharanee&mdash;mistress of all the
      jewels in the treasure-house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered. She did not look to find the blood; she took his word for
      that, if for nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you dare tell me that you plot against your brother!&rdquo; That was
      more a spoken thought than a statement or a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be very glad if you would warn my brother!&rdquo; he answered her; and
      she knew like a flash, and on the instant, that what he said was true. She
      had been warned before she came to bear no tales to any one. No Oriental
      would believe the tale, coming from her; the Maharajah would arrest her
      promptly, glad of the excuse to vent his hatred of Christian missionaries.
      Jaimihr would attempt a rescue; it was common knowledge that he plotted
      for the throne. There would be instant civil war, in which the British
      Government would perforce back up the alleged protector of a defenseless
      woman. There would be a new Maharajah; then, in a little while, and in all
      likelihood, she would have disappeared forever while the war raged. There
      would be, no doubt, a circumstantial story of her death from natural
      causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. She stared back at him, and he smiled down at her,
      twisting at his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; he said, nodding. &ldquo;A throne, sahiba, is considerably better than
      a grave!&rdquo; Then he wheeled like a sudden dust-devil and decamped in a cloud
      of dust, followed at full pelt by his clattering escort. She watched their
      horses leap one after the other the corpse of the Maharati that lay by the
      corner where it fell, and she saw the last of them go clattering, whirling
      up the street through the bazaar. The old hag rose out of a shadow and
      trotted after her again as she turned and rode on, pale-faced and crying
      now a little, to the little begged school place where her father tried to
      din the alphabet into a dozen low-caste fosterlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she cried, and she all but fell out of the saddle into his arms
      as the tall, lean Scotsman came to the door to meet her and stood blinking
      in the sunlight. &ldquo;Father, I've seen another man killed! I've had another
      scene with Jaimihr! I can't endure it! I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, why did I ever
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, dear,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But you would come, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Twixt loot and law&mdash;'tween creed and caste&mdash;
    Through slough this people wallows,
    To where we choose our road at last.
    I choose the RIGHT! Who follows?
</pre>
    <p>
      HEMMED in amid the stifling stench and babel of the caravansary, secluded
      by the very denseness of the many-minded swarm, five other Rajputs and
      Mahommed Gunga&mdash;all six, according to their turbans, followers of
      Islam&mdash;discussed matters that appeared to bring them little
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together in a dark, low-ceilinged room; its open door&mdash;it
      was far too hot to close anything that admitted air&mdash;gave straight
      onto the street, and the one big window opened on a courtyard, where a
      pair of game-cocks fought in and out between the restless legs of horses,
      while a yelling horde betted on them. On a heap of grass fodder in a
      corner of the yard an all-but-naked expert in inharmony thumped a skin
      tom-tom with his knuckles, while at his feet the own-blood brother to the
      screech-owls wailed of hell's torments on a wind instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Din&mdash;glamour&mdash;stink&mdash;incessant movement&mdash;interblended
      poverty and riches rubbing shoulders&mdash;noisy self-interest side by
      side with introspective revery, where stray priests nodded in among the
      traders,&mdash;many-peopled India surged in miniature between the four hot
      walls and through the passage to the overflowing street; changeable and
      unexplainable, in ever-moving flux, but more conservative in spite of it
      than the very rocks she rests on&mdash;India who is sister to Aholibah and
      mother of all fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that room with the long window, low-growled, the one thin thread of
      clear-sighted unselfishness was reeling out to very slight approval.
      Mahommed Gunga paced the floor and kicked his toes against the walls, as
      he turned at either end, until his spurs jingled, and looked with blazing
      dark-brown eyes from one man to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good ever came of listening to priests?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;All priests are
      alike&mdash;ours, and theirs, and padre-sahibs! They all preach peace and
      goad the lust that breeds war and massacre! Does a priest serve any but
      himself? Since when? There will come this rising that the priests speak of&mdash;yes!
      Of a truth, there will, for the priests will see to it! There is a
      padre-sahib here in Howrah now for the Hindoo priests to whet their hate
      on. You saw the woman ride past here a half-hour gone? There is a pile of
      tinder ready here, and any fool of a priest can make a spark! There will
      be a rising, and a big one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will! Of a truth, there will!&rdquo; Alwa, his cousin, crossed one leg
      above the other with a clink of spurs and scabbard. He had no objection to
      betraying interest, but declined for the present to betray his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a blood-letting that will do no harm to us Rajputs!&rdquo; said
      another man, whose eyes gleamed from the darkest corner; he, too, clanked
      his scabbard as though the sound were an obbligato to his thoughts. &ldquo;Sit
      still and say nothing is my advice; we will be all ready to help ourselves
      when the hour comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this way,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga, standing straddle-legged to face
      all five of them, with his back to the window. He stroked his black beard
      upward with one hand and fingered with the other at his sabre-hilt.
      &ldquo;Without aid when the hour does come, the English will be smashed&mdash;worn
      down&mdash;starved out&mdash;surrounded&mdash;stamped out&mdash;annihilated&mdash;so!&rdquo;
       He stamped with his heel descriptively on the hard earth floor. &ldquo;And then,
      what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, the plunder!&rdquo; said Alwa, showing a double row of wonderful white
      teeth. The other four grinned like his reflections. &ldquo;Ay, there will be
      plunder&mdash;for the priests! And we Rajputs will have new masters over
      us! Now, as things are, we have honorable men. They are fools, for any man
      is a fool who will not see and understand the signs. But they are honest.
      They ride straight! They look us straight between the eyes, and speak
      truth, and fear nobody! Will the Hindoo priests, who will rule India
      afterward, be thus? Nay! Here is one sword for the British when the hour
      comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have yet to see a Hindoo priest rule me or plunder me!&rdquo; said Alwa with
      a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will live to see it!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Truly, you will live to
      see it, unless you throw your weight into the other scale! What are we
      Rajputs without a leader whom we all trust? What have we ever been?&rdquo; He
      swung on his heels suddenly&mdash;angrily&mdash;and began to pace the
      floor again&mdash;then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divided, and again subdivided&mdash;one-fifth Mohammedan and four-fifths
      Hindoo&mdash;clan within clan, and each against the other. Do we own
      Rajputana? Nay! Do we rule it? Nay! What were we until Cunnigan-bahadur
      came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; All five men rose with a clank in honor to the memory of that man.
      &ldquo;Cunnigan-bahadur! Show us such another man as he was, and I and mine ride
      at his back!&rdquo; said Alwa. &ldquo;Not all the English are like Cunnigan! A
      Cunnigan could have five thousand men the minute that he asked for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a wizard?&mdash;Can I cast spells and bring dead men's spirits from
      the dead again? I know of no man to take his place,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the poorest of them, but they were all, comparatively speaking,
      poor men; for the long peace had told its tale on a race of men who are
      first gentlemen, then soldiers, and last&mdash;least of all&mdash;and only
      as a last resource, landed proprietors. The British, for whom they had
      often fought because that way honor seemed to lie, had impoverished them
      afterward by passing and enforcing zemindary laws that lifted nine-tenths
      of the burden from the necks of starving tenants. The new law was just, as
      the Rajputs grudgingly admitted, but it pinched their pockets sadly; like
      the old-time English squires, they would give their best blood and their
      last rack-rent-wrung rupee for the cause that they believed in, but they
      resented interference with the rack-rents! Mahommed Gunga had had
      influence enough with these five landlord relations of his to persuade
      them to come and meet him in Howrah City to discuss matters; the mere fact
      that he had thought it worth his while to leave his own little holding in
      the north had satisfied them that he would be well worth listening to&mdash;for
      no man rode six hundred miles on an empty errand. But they needed
      something more than words before they pledged the word that no Rajput
      gentleman will ever break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find us a Cunnigan&mdash;bring him to us&mdash;prove him to us&mdash;and
      if a blade worth having from end to end of Rajputana is not at his
      service, I myself will gut the Hindoo owner of it! That is my given word!&rdquo;
       said Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a son,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. Are all sons like their fathers? Take Maharajah Howrah here; his
      father was a man with whom any soldier might be proud to pick a quarrel.
      The present man is afraid of his own shadow on the wall&mdash;divided
      between love for the treasure-chests he dare not broach and fear of a
      brother whom he dare not kill. He is priest-ridden, priest-taught, and fit
      to be nothing but a priest. Who knows how young Cunnigan will shape? Where
      is he? Overseas yet! He must prove himself, as his father did, before he
      can hope to lead a free regiment of horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Cunnigan-bahadur's watch-word 'For the peace of India,' is dead-died
      with him?&rdquo; asked Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;We are each for our own again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken!&rdquo; answered Alwa. As the biggest clan-chief left on all that
      countryside, he had a right to speak before the others, and he knew that
      what he said would carry weight when they had all ridden home again, and
      the report had gone abroad in ever-widening rings. &ldquo;If the English can
      hold India, let them! I will not fight against them, for they are honest
      men for all their madness. If they cannot, then I am for Rajputana, not
      India&mdash;India may burn or rot or burst to pieces, so long as Rajputana
      stands! But&mdash;&rdquo; He paused a moment, and looked at each man in turn,
      and tapped his sabre-hilt, &ldquo;&mdash;if a Cunnigan-bahadur were among us&mdash;a
      man whom I could trust to lead me and mine and every man&mdash;I would
      lend him my sword for the sheer honor of helping him hack truth out of
      corruption! I have nothing more to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, cousin!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;I was risaldar in
      Cunnigan-bahadur's regiment of horse. There was more than mere discipline
      between us. I ate his salt. Once&mdash;when he might have saved himself
      the trouble without any daring to reproach him&mdash;he risked his own
      life, and a troop, and his reputation to save a woman of my family from
      capture, and something worse. There was never a Rajput or any other native
      woman wronged while he was with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no friend of Christian priests&mdash;of padres. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She who rode by just now? What, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ride northward now, and then very likely South again. I can do nothing
      in the matter, yet&mdash;were he in my shoes, and she a native woman at
      the mercy of the troops&mdash;Cunnigan-bahadur would have assigned a guard
      for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! So I am thy sepoy?&rdquo; sneered Alwa, standing sideways&mdash;looking
      sideways&mdash;and throwing out his chest. &ldquo;I am to do thy bidding,
      guarding stray padres&rdquo; (he spoke the word as though it were a bad taste he
      was spitting from his mouth), &ldquo;and herding women without purdah, while
      thou ridest on assignations Allah knows where? Since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have yet to refuse to guard thy back, or thy good name, Alwa!&rdquo; Mahommed
      Gunga eyed him straight, and thrust his hilt out. &ldquo;The woman is nothing to
      me&mdash;the padre-sahib less. It is because of the debt I owe to Cunnigan
      that I ask this favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. It is granted! Should she appeal to me, I will rip Howrah into rags
      and burn this city to protect her if need be! She must first ask, though,
      even as thou didst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga saluted him, bolt-upright as a lance, and without the
      slightest change in his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word is sufficient, cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa returned his salute, and raised his voice in a gruff command. A saice
      outside the window woke as though struck by a stick&mdash;sprang to his
      feet&mdash;and passed the order on. A dozen horses clattered in the
      courtyard and filed through the arched passage to the street, and Alwa
      mounted. The others, each with his escort, followed suit, and a moment
      later, with no further notice of one another, but with as much pomp and
      noise as though they owned the whole of India, the five rode off, each on
      his separate way, through the scattering crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mahommed Gunga called for his own horse and the lone armed man of his
      own race who acted squire to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any overhear our talk?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the saice, even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sahib. He slept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He awoke most suddenly, and at not much noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that reason I know he slept, sahib. Had he been pretending, he would
      have wakened slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art no idiot!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Wait here until I return, and
      lie a few lies if any ask thee why we six came together, and of what we
      spoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he mounted and rode off slowly, picking his way through the throng
      much more cautiously and considerately than his relatives had done, though
      not, apparently, because he loved the crowd. He used some singularly
      biting insults to help clear the way, and frowned as though every other
      man he looked at were either an assassin or&mdash;what a good Mohammedan
      considers worse&mdash;an infidel. He reached the long brick wall at last&mdash;broke
      into a canter&mdash;scattered the pariah dogs that were nosing and
      quarreling about the corpse of the Maharati, and drew rein fifteen minutes
      later by the door of the tiny school place that Miss McClean had entered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      For service truly rendered, and for duty dumbly done&mdash;For men who
      neither tremble nor forget&mdash;There is due reward, my henchman. There
      is honor to be won. There is watch and ward and sterner duty yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound came, from within the schoolhouse. The little building, coaxed
      from a grudging Maharajah, seemed to strain for light and air between two
      overlapping, high-walled brick warehouses. Before the door, in a spot
      where the scorching sun-rays came but fitfully between a mesh of
      fast-decaying thatch, the old hag who had followed Rosemary McClean lay
      snoozing, muttering to herself, and blinking every now and then as a
      street dog blinks at the passers-by. She took no notice of Mahommed Gunga
      until he swore at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss-sahib hai?&rdquo; he growled; and the woman jumped up in a hurry and went
      inside. A moment later Rosemary McClean stood framed in the doorway still
      in her cotton riding-habit, very pale&mdash;evidently frightened at the
      summons&mdash;but strangely, almost ethereally, beautiful. Her wealth of
      chestnut hair was loosely coiled above her neck, as though she had been
      caught in the act of dressing it. She looked like the wan, wasted spirit
      of human pity&mdash;he like a great, grim war-god.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, Miss Maklin-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted as he spoke and stood at attention, then stared truculently,
      too inherently chivalrous to deny her civility&mdash;he would have cut his
      throat as soon as address her from horseback while she stood&mdash;and too
      contemptuous of her father's calling to be more civil than he deemed in
      keeping with his honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, Mohammed Gunga!&rdquo; She seemed very much relieved, although doubtful
      yet. &ldquo;Not letters again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss-sahib. I am no mail-carrier! I brought those letters as a favor
      to Franklin-sahib at Peshawur; I was coming hither, and he had no man to
      send. I will take letters, since I am now going, if there are letters
      ready; I ride to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mahommed Gunga. I have letters for England. They are not yet
      sealed. May I send them to you before you start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send my man for them. Also, Miss Maklin-sahib&rdquo; (heavens! how much
      cleaner and better that sounded than the prince's ironical &ldquo;sahiba&rdquo;!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it, I will escort you to Peshawur, or to any city between
      here and there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Jaimihr. I know Jaimihr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;this is no place for a padre, or for the daughter of a padre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he said was true, but it was also insolent, said insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahommed Gunga-sahib, what are those ribbons on your breast?&rdquo; she asked
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down at them, and his expression changed a trifle; it was
      scarcely perceptible, but underneath his fierce mustache the muscles of
      his mouth stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are medal ribbons&mdash;for campaigns,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-four-five! Then, you were a soldier a long time? Did you&mdash;did
      you desert your post when there was danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed, and raised his hand as though about to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or did people insult you when you chose to remain on duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss-sahib, I have not insulted you!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;I came here
      for another purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came, very kindly, to ask whether there were letters. Thank you,
      Mahommed Gunga-sahib, for your courtesy. There are letters, and I will
      give them to your man, if you will be good enough to send him for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still stood there, staring at her with eyes that did not blink. He was
      too much of a soldier to admit himself at a loss what to say, yet he had
      no intention of leaving Howrah without saying it, for that, too, would
      have been unsoldierly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason why your countrymen have found men of this land before now to
      fight for them&mdash;one reason, at least&mdash;&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;is
      that hitherto they have not meddled with our religions. It is not safe! It
      would be better to come away, Miss-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to say that to my father? He is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allah forbid that I should argue with him! I spoke to you, on your
      account!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, I think,&rdquo; she answered him gently, &ldquo;that we had permission
      from the British Government to come here; it has not been withdrawn. We
      are doing no harm here&mdash;trying only to do good. There is always
      danger when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would speak of that,&rdquo; he interrupted&mdash;&ldquo;You will not come away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father could remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head again. &ldquo;I stay with him,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, Jaimihr is the danger, Miss-sahib; but I think that at
      present he will dare do nothing. The Maharajah dare do nothing either,
      yet. Should either of them make a move to interfere with you, it would not
      be safe to appeal to the other one. You will not understand, but it is so.
      In that event, there is a way to safety of which I would warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mahommed Gunga. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are men more than a day's ride away from here who are to be
      depended on&mdash;by you, at least&mdash;under all circumstances. Is that
      old woman to be trusted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I believe she is fond of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That should be enough. I would like, if the Miss-sahib will permit, to
      speak with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a word from Miss McClean the old hag came out into the sun again and
      blinked at the Rajput, very much afraid of him. Mahommed Gunga saluted
      Miss McClean&mdash;swore at the old woman&mdash;pointed a wordless order
      with his right arm&mdash;watched her shuffle half a hundred yards
      up-street&mdash;followed her, and growled at her for about five minutes,
      while she nodded. Finally, he drew from the pocket of his crimson coat a
      small handful of gold mohurs&mdash;fat, dignified coins that glittered&mdash;and
      held them out toward her with an air as though they meant nothing to him&mdash;positively
      nothing&mdash;Her eyes gleamed. He let her take a good look at the money
      before replacing it, then tossed her a silver quarter-rupee piece, saluted
      Miss McClean again&mdash;for she was watching the pantomime from the
      doorway still&mdash;and mounted and rode off, his back looking like the
      back of one who has neither care nor fear nor master.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the caravansary his squire came running out to hold his stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Picket the horse in the yard,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga, &ldquo;then find me another
      servant and bring him to me in the room here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another servant? But, sahib&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said another servant! Has deafness overcome thee?&rdquo; He used a word in
      the dialect which left no room for doubt as to his meaning; it was to be a
      different servant&mdash;a substitute for the squire he had already. The
      squire bowed his head in disciplined obedience and led the horse away.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later&mdash;evening was drawing on&mdash;he came back, followed by
      a somewhat ruffianly-looking half-breed Rajput-Punjaubi. The new man was
      rather ragged and lacked one eye, but with the single eye he had he looked
      straight at his prospective master. Mahommed Gunga glared at him, but the
      man did not quail or shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow wishes honorable service, sahib.&rdquo; The squire spoke as though
      he were calling his master's attention to a horse that was for sale. &ldquo;I
      have seen his family; I have inquired about him; and I have explained to
      him that unless he serves at thee faithfully his wife and his man child
      will die at my hands in his absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he groom a horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he says, sahib, and so say others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He slew the man with his bare hands who pricked his eye out with a
      sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What payment does he ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He leaves that matter to your honor's pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Instruct him, then. Set him to cleaning my horse and then return
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire was back again within five minutes and stood before Mahommed
      Gunga in silent expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss thee,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga after five minutes' reflection.
      &ldquo;It is well that I have other servants in the north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what have I offended, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In nothing. Therefore there is a trust imposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man salaamed. Mahommed Gunga produced his little handful of gold
      mohurs and divided it into two equal portions; one he handed to the
      squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here. Be always either in the caravansary or else at call. Should
      the old woman who serves Miss Maklin-sahib, the padre-sahib's daughter
      come and ask thy aid, then saddle swiftly the three horses I will leave
      with thee, and bear Miss Maklin-sahib and her father to my cousin Alwa's
      place. Present two of the gold mohurs to the hag, should that happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sahib&mdash;two mohurs? I could buy ten such hags outright for the
      price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has my word in the matter! It is best to have her eager to win great
      reward. The hag will stay awake, but see to it that thou sleepest not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for how long must I stay here, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One month&mdash;six months&mdash;a year&mdash;who knows? Until the hag
      summons thee, or I, by writing or by word of mouth, relieve thee of thy
      trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At sunset he sent the squire to Miss McClean for the letters he had
      promised to deliver; and at one hour after sunset, when the heat of the
      earth had begun to rise and throw back a hot blast to the darkened sky and
      the little eddies of luke-warm surface wind made movement for horse and
      man less like a fight with scorching death, he rode off, with his new
      servant, on the two horses left to him of the five with which he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      A six-hundred-mile ride without spare horses, in the heat of northern
      India, was an undertaking to have made any strong man flinch. The stronger
      the man, and the more soldierly, the better able he would be to realize
      the effort it would call for. But Mahommed Gunga rode as though he were
      starting on a visit to a near-by friend; he was not given to crossing
      bridges before he reached them, nor to letting prospects influence his
      peace of mind. He was a soldier. He took precautions first, when and where
      such were possible, then rode and looked fate in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to take no more notice of the glowering looks that followed
      him from stuffy balconies and dense-packed corners than of the mosquitoes
      to and the heat. Without hurry he picked his way through the thronged
      streets, where already men lay in thousands to escape the breathlessness
      of walled interiors; the gutters seemed like trenches where the dead of a
      devastated city had been laid; the murmur was like the voice of
      storm-winds gathering, and the little lights along the housetops were for
      the vent-holes on the lid of a tormented underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he rode on at his ease. Ahead of him lay that which he considered
      duty. He could feel the long-kept peace of India disintegrating all around
      him, and he knew&mdash;he was certain&mdash;as sometimes a brave man can
      see what cleverer men all overlook&mdash;that the right touch by the right
      man at the right moment, when the last taut-held thread should break,
      would very likely swing the balance in favor of peace again, instead of
      individual self seeking anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew what &ldquo;Cunnigan-bahadur&rdquo; would have done. He swore by
      Cunnigan-bahadur. And the memory of that same dead, desperately honest
      Cunningham he swore that no personal profit or convenience or safety
      should be allowed to stand between him and what was honorable and right!
      Mahommed Gunga had no secrets from himself; nor lack of imagination. He
      knew that he was riding&mdash;not to preserve the peace of India, for that
      was as good as gone&mdash;but to make possible the winning back of it. And
      he rode with a smile on his thin lips, as the crusaders once rode on a
      less self-advertising errand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;You have failed!&rdquo; whispered Fate, and a weary civilian
    Threw up his task as a matter of course.
    &ldquo;Failed?&rdquo; said the soldier.  He knew a million
    Chances untackled yet. &ldquo;Get me a horse!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      THAT was a strange ride of Mahommed Gunga's, and a fateful one&mdash;more
      full of portent for the British Raj in India than he, or the British, or
      the men amid whose homes he rode could ever have anticipated. He averaged
      a little less than twenty miles a day, and through an Indian hot-weather,
      and with no spare horse, none but a born horseman&mdash;a man of light
      weight and absolute control of temper&mdash;could have accomplished that
      for thirty days on end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever he rode there was the same unrest. Here and there were new
      complaints he had not yet heard of, imaginary some of them, and some only
      too well founded. Wherever there were Rajputs&mdash;and that race of
      fighting men is scattered all about the north&mdash;there was
      ill-suppressed impatience for the bursting of the wrath to come. They bore
      no grudge against the English, but they did bear more than grudge against
      the money-lenders and the fat, litigious traders who had fattened under
      British rule. At least at the beginning it was evident that all the
      interest of all the Rajputs lay in letting the British get the worst of
      it; even should the British suddenly wake up and look about them and take
      steps&mdash;or should the British hold their own with native aid, and so
      save India from anarchy, and afterward reward the men who helped&mdash;the
      Rajputs would stand to gain less individually, or even collectively, than
      if they let the English be driven to the sea, and then reverted to the
      age-old state of feudal lawlessness that once had made them rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the Hindoo element among them were almost openly disloyal. The
      ryots&mdash;the little one and two acre farmers&mdash;were the least
      unsettled; they, when he asked them&mdash;and he asked often&mdash;disclaimed
      the least desire to change a rule that gave them safe holdings and but one
      tax-collection a year; they were frankly for their individual selves&mdash;not
      even for one another, for the ryots as a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody seemed to be for India, except Mahommed Gunga; and he said little,
      but asked ever-repeated questions as he rode. There were men who would
      like to weld Rajputana into one again, and over-ride the rest of India;
      and there were other men who planned to do the same for the Punjaub; there
      were plots within plots, not many of which he learned in anything like
      detail, but none of which were more than skin-deep below the surface. All
      men looked to the sudden, swift, easy whelming of the British Raj, and
      then to the plundering of India; each man expected to be rich when the
      whelming came, and each man waited with ill-controlled impatience for the
      priests' word that would let loose the hundred-million flood of anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one man&mdash;one real man whom they trusted&mdash;one leader&mdash;one
      man who had one thousand at his back&mdash;could change the whole face of
      things!&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Would God there we a Cunnigan! But there
      is no Cunnigan. And who would follow me? They would pull my beard, tell me
      I was scheming for my own ends!&mdash;I, who was taught by Cunnigan, and
      would serve only India!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would ride before dawn and when the evening breeze had come to cool the
      hot earth a little through the blazing afternoons he would lie in the
      place of honor by some open window, where he could watch a hireling flick
      the flies off his lean, road-hardened horse, and listen to the plotting
      and the carried tales of plots, pretending always to be sympathetic or
      else open to conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier? Hah! A soldier fights for the side that can best reward him!&rdquo;
       he would grin. &ldquo;And, when there is no side, perhaps he makes one! I am a
      soldier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If they pressed him, he would point to his medal ribbons, that he always
      wore. &ldquo;The British gave me those for fighting against the northern tribes
      beyond the Himalayas,&rdquo; he would tell them. &ldquo;The southern tribes&mdash;Bengalis
      of the south and east&mdash;would give better picking than mere medal
      ribbons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were not all sure of him. They were not all satisfied why he should
      ride on to Peshawur, and decline to stay with them and talk good sedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would see how the British are!&rdquo; he told them. And he told the truth.
      But they were not quite satisfied; he would have made a splendid leader to
      have kept among them, until he&mdash;too&mdash;became too powerful and
      would have to be deposed in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own holding was a long way from Peshawur, and he was no rich man who
      could afford at a mere whim to ride two long days' march beyond his goal.
      Nor was he, as he had explained to Miss McClean, a letter-carrier; he
      would get no more than the merest thanks for delivering her letters to
      where they could be included in the Government mail-bag. Yet he left the
      road that would have led him homeward to his left, and carried on&mdash;quickening
      his pace as he neared the frontier garrison town, and wasting, then, no
      time at all on seeking information. Nobody supposed that the Pathans and
      the other frontier tribes were anything but openly rebellious, and he
      would have been an idiot to ask questions about their loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of their disloyalty, and the ever-present danger that they were,
      the biggest British garrison in India had to be kept cooped up in
      Peshawur, to rot with fever and ague and the other ninety Indian plagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to see that garrison again, and estimate it, and make up his
      mind what exactly, or probably, the garrison would do in the event of the
      rebellion blazing out. And he wanted to try once more to warn some one in
      authority, and make him see the smouldering fire beneath the outer
      covering of sullen silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received thanks for the letters. He received an invitation to take tea
      on the veranda of an officer so high in the British service that many a
      staff major would have given a month's pay for a like opportunity. But he
      was laughed at for the advice he had to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahommed Gunga, you're like me, you're getting old!&rdquo; said the high
      official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so very old, sahib. I was a young man when Cunnigan-bahadur raised a
      regiment and licked the half of Rajputana into shape with it. Not too old,
      sahib, to wish there were another Cunnigan to ride with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mahommed Gunga, you're closer to your wish than you suppose! Young
      Cunningham's gazetted, and probably just about starting on his way out
      here via the Cape of Good Hope. He should be here in three or four months
      at the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I didn't! The puppy will arrive here with altogether swollen notions
      of his own importance and what is due his father's son. He's been captain
      of his college at home, and that won't lessen his sense of self-esteem
      either. I can foresee trouble with that boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, there is a service I could render!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput spoke with a strangely constrained voice all of a sudden, but
      the Commissioner did not notice it; he was too busy pulling on a
      wool-lined jacket to ward off the evening chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, risaldar&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I could teach the son of Cunnigan-bahadur to be worth his
      salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll teach him to be properly respectful to his betters I'll be
      grateful to you, Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sahib, I shall have certain license allowed me in the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do anything you like, in reason, risaldar! Only keep the pup from cutting
      his eye-teeth on his seniors' convenience, that's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga wasted no time after that on talking, nor did he wait to
      specify the nature of the latitude he would expect to be allowed him; he
      knew better. And he knew now that the one chance that he sought had been
      given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all observant natives, he was perfectly aware that the British
      weakness mostly lay in the age of the senior officers and the slowness of
      promotion. There were majors of over fifty years of age, and if a man were
      a general at seventy he was considered fortunate and young. The jealousy
      with which younger men were regarded would have been humorous had it not
      come already so near to plunging India into anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not even trouble to overlook the garrison. He took his leave, and
      rode away the long two-day ride to his own place, where a sadly attenuated
      rent-roll and a very sadly thinned-down company of servants waited his
      coming. There, through fourteen hurried, excited days, he made certain
      arrangements about the disposition of his affairs during an even longer
      absence; he made certain sales&mdash;pledged the rent of fifty acres for
      ten years, in return for an advance&mdash;and on the fifteenth day rode
      southward, at the head of a five-man escort that, for quality, was worthy
      of a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little less than three months later he arrived at Bombay, and by dint of
      much hard bargaining and economy fitted out himself and his escort, so
      that each man looked as though he were the owner of an escort of his own.
      Then, fretful at every added day that strained his fast-diminishing
      resources, he settled down to wait until the ship should come that brought
      young Cunningham.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Lies home beneath a sickly sun,
            Where humbleness was taught me?
    Or here, where spurs my father won
            On bended knee are brought me?
</pre>
    <p>
      HE landed, together with about a dozen other newly gazetted subalterns and
      civil officers, cramped, storm-tossed, snubbed, and then disgorged from a
      sailing-ship into a port that made no secret of its absolute contempt for
      new arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were liners of a kind on the Red Sea route, and the only seniors who
      chose the long passage round the Cape were men returning after sick-leave&mdash;none
      too sweet-tempered individuals, and none too prone to give the young idea
      a good conceit of himself. He and the other youngsters landed with a
      crushed-in notion that India would treat them very cavalierly before she
      took them to herself. And all, save Cunningham, were right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other men, all homesick and lonely and bewildered, were met by
      bankers' agents, or, in cases, only by a hotel servant armed with a letter
      of instructions. Here and there a bored, tired-eyed European had found
      time, for somebody-or-other's sake, to pounce on a new arrival and bear
      him away to breakfast and a tawdry imitation of the real hospitality of
      northern India; but for the most part the beardless boys lounged in the
      red-hot customs shed (where they were to be mulcted for the privilege of
      serving their country) and envied young Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      He&mdash;as pale as they, as unexpectant as they were of anything
      approaching welcome&mdash;was first amazed, then suspicious, then pleased,
      then proud, in turn. The different emotions followed one another across
      his clean-lined face as plainly as a dawn vista changes; then, as the dawn
      leaves a landscape finally, true and what it is for all to see, true
      dignity was left and the look of a man who stands in armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father's son!&rdquo; growled Mahommed Gunga; and the big, black-bearded
      warriors who stood behind him echoed, &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for four or five inches of straight stature, and a foot, perhaps, of
      chest-girth, he was a second edition of the Cunnigan-bahadur who had
      raised and led a regiment and licked peace into a warring countryside; and
      though he was that much bigger than his father had been, they dubbed him
      &ldquo;Chota&rdquo; Cunnigan on the instant. And that means &ldquo;Little Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had yet to learn that a Rajput, be he poorest of the poor, admits no
      superior on earth. He did not know yet that these men had come, at one
      man's private cost, all down the length of India to meet him. Nobody had
      told him that the feudal spirit dies harder in northern Hindustan than it
      ever did in England, or that the Rajput clans cohere more tightly than the
      Scots. The Rajput belief that honest service&mdash;unselfishly given&mdash;is
      the greatest gift that any man may bring&mdash;that one who has received
      what he considers favors will serve the giver's son&mdash;was an unknown
      creed to him as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he stood and looked those six men in the eye, and liked them. And
      they, before they had as much as heard him speak, knew him for a soldier
      and loved him as he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hung sickly scented garlands round his neck, and kissed his hand in
      turn, and spoke to him thereafter as man to man. They had found their goal
      worth while, and they bore him off to his hotel in clattering glee, riding
      before him as men who have no doubt of the honor that they pay themselves.
      No other of the homesick subalterns drove away with a six-man escort to
      clear the way and scatter sparks!
    </p>
    <p>
      They careered round through the narrow gate of the hotel courtyard as
      though a Viceroy at least were in the trap behind them; and Mahommed Gunga&mdash;six
      medaled, strapping feet of him&mdash;dismounted and held out an arm for
      him to take when he alighted. The hotel people understood at once that
      Somebody from Somewhere had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Cunningham had never yet been somebody. The men who give their lives
      for India are nothing much at home, and their sons are even less. Scarcely
      even at school, when they had made him captain of the team, had he felt
      the feel of homage and the subtle flattery that undermines a bad man's
      character; at schools in England they confer honors but take simultaneous
      precautions. He was green to the dangerous influence of feudal loyalty,
      but he quitted himself well, with reserve and dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is good! He will do!&rdquo; swore Mahommed Gunga fiercely, for the other
      emotions are meant for women only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is better than the best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make a man of this one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mark how he handed me his purse to defray expenses?&rdquo; asked a
      black-bearded soldier of the five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man who knows by instinct!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;See to it that
      thy accounting is correct, and overpay no man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deep-throated as a bull, erect as a lance, and pleased as a little child,
      Mahommed Gunga came to him alone that evening to talk, and to hear him
      talk, and to tell him of the plans that had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father gave me this,&rdquo; he told him, producing a gold watch and chain
      of the hundred-guinea kind that nowadays are only found among the
      heirlooms. Young Cunningham looked at it, and recognized the heavy
      old-gold case that he had been allowed to &ldquo;blow open&rdquo; when a little boy.
      On the outside, deep-chiseled in the gold, was his father's crest, and on
      the inside a portrait of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father died in these two arms, bahadur! Thy father said: 'Look after
      him, Mahommed Gunga, when the time is ripe for him to be a soldier.' And I
      said: 'Ha, huzoor!' So! Then here is India!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved one hand grandiloquently, as though he were presenting the throne
      of India to his protegé!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sahib, is a servant&mdash;blood of my own blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clapped his hands, and a man who looked like the big, black-ended
      spirit of Aladdin's lamp stood silent, instant, in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks no English, but he may help to teach thee the Rajput tongue,
      and he will serve thee well&mdash;on my honor. His throat shall answer for
      it! Feed him and clothe him, sahib, but pay him very little&mdash;to serve
      well is sufficient recompense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Cunningham gave his keys at once to the silent servant, as a tacit
      sign that from that moment he was trusted utterly; and Mahommed Gunga
      nodded grim approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father saw fit to bequeath me much in the hour when death came on
      him, sahib. I am no boaster, as he knew. Remember, then, to tell me if I
      fail at any time in what is due. I am at thy service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tact was inborn in Cunningham, as it had been in his father. He realized
      that he ought at once to show his appreciation of the high plane of the
      service offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one way in which you could help me almost at once, Mahommed
      Gunga,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command me, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need your advice&mdash;the advice of a man who really knows. I need
      horses, and&mdash;at first at least&mdash;I would rather trust your
      judgment than my own. Will you help me buy them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Raiput's eyes blazed pleasure. On war, and wine, and women, and a
      horse are the four points to ask a man's advice and win his approval by
      the asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib; why buy horses here? These Bombay traders have only crows'
      meat to sell to the ill-advised. I have horses, and spare horses for the
      journey; and in Rajputana I have horses waiting for thee&mdash;seven, all
      told&mdash;sufficient for a young officer. Six of them are
      country-bred-sand-weaned&mdash;a little wild perhaps, but strong, and up
      to thy weight. The seventh is a mare, got by thy father's stallion Aga
      Khan (him that made more than a hundred miles within a day under a
      fifteen-stone burden, with neither food nor water, and survived!). A good
      mare, sahib&mdash;indeed a mare of mares&mdash;fit for thy father's son.
      That mare I give thee. It is little, sahib, but my best; I am a poor man.
      The other six I bought&mdash;there is the account. I bought them cheaply,
      paying less than half the price demanded in each case&mdash;but I had to
      borrow and must pay back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Cunningham was hard put to it to keep his voice steady as he
      answered. This man was a stranger to him. He had a hazy recollection of a
      dozen or more bearded giants who formed a moving background to his dreams
      of infancy, and he had expected some sort of welcome from one or two
      perhaps, of his father's men when he reached the north. But to have men
      borrow money that they might serve him, and have horses ready for him, and
      to be met like this at the gate of India by a man who admitted he was
      poor, was a little more than his self-control had been trained as yet to
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't waste words, Mahommed Gunga,&rdquo; he said, half-choking. &ldquo;I'll&mdash;er&mdash;I'll
      try to prove how I feel about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! How said I? Thy father's son, I said! He, too, was no believer in
      much promising! I was his servant, and will serve him still by serving
      thee. The honor is mine, sahib, and the advantage shall be where thy
      father wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father would never have had me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, forgive the interruption, but a mistake is better checked. Thy
      father would have flung thee ungrudged, into a hell of bayonets, me, too,
      and would have followed after, if by so doing he could have served the
      cause he held in trust. He bred thee, fed thee, and sent thee oversea to
      grow, that in the end India might gain! Thou and I are but servants of the
      peace, as he was. If I serve thee, and thou the Raj&mdash;though the two
      of us were weaned on the milk of war and get our bread by war&mdash;we
      will none the less serve peace! Aie! For what is honor if a soldier lets
      it rust? Of what use is service, mouthed and ready, but ungiven? It is
      good, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur, that thou art come at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saluted and backed out through the swinging door. He had come in his
      uniform of risaldar of the elder Cunningham's now disbanded regiment, so
      he had not removed his boots as another native&mdash;and he himself if in
      mufti&mdash;would have done. Young Cunningham heard him go swaggering and
      clanking and spur-jingling down the corridor as though he had half a troop
      of horse behind him and wanted Asia to know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something of a brave beginning that, for a twenty-one-year-old!
      Something likely&mdash;and expressly calculated by Mahommed Gunga&mdash;to
      bring the real man to the surface. He had been no Cunningham unless his
      sense of duty had been very near the surface&mdash;no Englishman, had he
      not been proud that men of a foreign, conquered race should think him
      worthy of all that honor; and no man at all if his eye had been quite dry
      when the veteran light-horseman swaggered out at last and left him to his
      own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been human if he had not felt a little homesick still, although
      home to him had been a place where a man stayed with distant relatives
      between the intervals of school. He felt lonely, in spite of his reception&mdash;a
      little like a baby on the edge of all things new and wonderful. He would
      have been no European if he had not felt the heat, the hotel was like a
      vapor-bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the leaping red blood of youth ran strong in him. He had imagination.
      He could dream. The good things he was tasting were a presage only of the
      better things to come, and that is a wholesome point of view. He was proud&mdash;as
      who would not be?&mdash;to step straight into the tracks of such a father;
      and with that thought came another&mdash;just as good for him, and for
      India, that made him feel as though he were a robber yet, a thief in
      another's cornfield, gathering what he did not sow. It came over him in a
      flood that he must pay the price of all this homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men pay in advance, some at the time, and some pay afterward. All
      men, he knew, must pay. It would be his task soon to satisfy these
      gentle-men, who took him at his face value, by proving to them that they
      had made no very great mistake. The thought thrilled him instead of
      frightening&mdash;brought out every generous instinct that he had and made
      him thank the God of All Good Soldiers that at least he would have a
      chance to die in the attempt. There was nothing much the matter with young
      Cunningham.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    I take no man at rumor's price,
            Nor as the gossips cry him.
    A son may ride, and stride, and stand;
            His father's eye&mdash;his father's hand&mdash;
    His father's tongue may give command;
            But ere I trust I'll try him!
</pre>
    <p>
      BUT before young Cunningham was called upon to pay even a portion of the
      price of fealty there was more of the receiving of it still in store for
      him, and he found himself very hard put to it, indeed, to keep overboiling
      spirits from becoming exultation of the type that nauseates.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the other subalterns had influence, nor had they hereditary
      anchors in the far northwest that would be likely to draw them on to
      active service early in their career. They had already been made to
      surrender their boyhood dreams of quick promotion; now, standing in little
      groups and asking hesitating questions, they discovered that their
      destination&mdash;Fort William&mdash;was about the least desirable of all
      the awful holes in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were told that a subaltern was lucky who could mount one step of the
      promotion ladder in his first ten years; that a major at fifty, a colonel
      at sixty, and a general at seventy were quite the usual thing. And they
      realized that the pay they would receive would be a mere beggar's pittance
      in a neighborhood so expensive as Calcutta, and that their little private
      means would be eaten up by the mere, necessities of life. They showed
      their chagrin and it was not very easy for young Cunningham, watching
      Mahommed Gunga's lordly preparations for the long up-country journey, to
      strike just the right attitude of pleasure at the prospect without seeming
      to flaunt his better fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga interlarded his hoarse orders to the mule-drivers with
      descriptions in stateliest English, thrown out at random to the world at
      large, of the glories of the manlier north&mdash;of the plains, where a
      man might gallop while a horse could last, and of the mountains up beyond
      the plains. He sniffed at the fetid Bombay reek, and spoke of the clean
      air sweeping from the snow-topped Himalayas, that put life and courage
      into the lungs of men who rode like centaurs! And the other subalterns
      looked wistful, eying the bullock-carts that would take their baggage by
      another route.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully the half of what Mahommed Gunga said was due to pride of race and
      country. But the rest was all deliberately calculated to rouse the wicked
      envy of those who listened. He meant to make the son of &ldquo;Pukka&rdquo; Cunnigan
      feel, before he reached his heritage, that he was going up to something
      worth his while. To quote his own north-country metaphor, he meant to
      &ldquo;make the colt come up the bit.&rdquo; He meant that &ldquo;Chota&rdquo; Cunnigan should
      have a proper sense of his own importance, and should chafe at restraint,
      to the end that when his chance did come to prove himself he would jump at
      it. Envy, he calculated&mdash;the unrighteous envy of men less fortunately
      placed&mdash;would make a good beginning. And it did, though hardly in the
      way he calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Cunningham, tight-lipped to keep himself from grinning like a child,
      determined to prove himself worthy of the better fortune; and Mahommed
      Gunga would have cursed into his black beard in disgust had he known of
      the private resolutions being formed to obey orders to the letter and
      obtain the good will of his seniors. The one thing that the grim old
      Rajput wished for his protege was jealousy! He wanted him so well hated by
      the &ldquo;nabobs&rdquo; who had grown crusty and incompetent in high command that
      life for him in any northern garrison would be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the two months' journey to the north Mahommed Gunga never left
      a stone unturned to make Cunningham believe himself much more than
      ordinary clay. All along the trunk road, that trails by many thousand
      towns and listens to a hundred languages, whatever good there was was
      Cunningham's. Whichever room was best in each dak-bungalow, whichever
      chicken the kansamah least desired to kill, whoever were the stoutest
      dhoolee-bearers in the village, whichever horse had the easiest paces&mdash;all
      were Cunningham's. Respect were his, and homage and obeisance, for the
      Rajput saw to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of evenings, while they rested, but before the sun went down, the old
      risaldar would come with his naked sabre and defy &ldquo;Chota&rdquo; Cunnigan to try
      to touch him. For five long weeks he tried each evening, the Rajput never
      doing anything but parry,&mdash;changing his sabre often to the other hand
      and grinning at the schoolboy swordsmanship&mdash;until one evening, at
      the end of a more than usually hard-fought bout, the youngster pricked
      him, lunged, and missed slitting his jugular by the merest fraction of an
      inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; laughed Mahommed Gunga later, as he sluiced out the cut while his
      own adherents stood near by and chaffed him. &ldquo;The cub cuts his teeth,
      then! Soon it will be time to try his pluck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be gentle with him, risaldar-sahib; a good cub dies as easily as a poor
      one, until he knows the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him to me! I will show him the way, and we will see what we will
      see. If he is to disgrace his father's memory and us, he shall do it where
      there are few to see and none to talk of it. When Alwa and the others ask
      me, as they will ask, 'Is he a man?' I will give them a true answer! I
      think he is a man, but I need to test him in all ways possible before I
      pledge my word on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after that little accident the old risaldar had sword-sticks fashioned
      at a village near the road, and ran no more risks of being killed by the
      stripling he would teach; and before many more days of the road had
      ribboned out, young Cunningham&mdash;bareback or from the saddle&mdash;could
      beat him to the ground, and could hold his own on foot afterward with
      either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hand and eye are good!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;It is time now for
      another test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he made a plausible excuse about the horses, and they halted for four
      days at a roadside dak-bungalow about a mile from where a foul-mouthed
      fakir sat and took tribute at a crossroads. It was a strangely chosen
      place to rest at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep down in a hollow, where the trunk road took advantage of a winding
      gorge between the hills&mdash;screened on nearly all sides by green jungle
      whose brown edges wilted in the heat which the inner steam defied&mdash;stuffy,
      smelly, comfortless, it stood like a last left rear-guard of a white-man's
      city, swamped by the deathless, ceaselessly advancing tide of green. It
      was tucked between mammoth trees that had been left there when the space
      for it was cleared a hundred years before, and that now stood like grim
      giant guardians with arms out-stretched to hold the verdure back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little tribe of camp-followers chased at least a dozen snakes out of
      corners, and slew them in the open, as a preliminary to further
      investigation. There were kas-kas mats on the foursquare floors, and each
      of these, when lifted, disclosed a swarm of scorpions that had to be
      exterminated before a man dared move his possessions in. The once white
      calico ceilings moved suggestively where rats and snakes chased one
      another, or else hunted some third species of vermin; and there was a
      smell and a many-voiced weird whispering that hinted at corruption and war
      to the death behind skirting boards and underneath the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had evidently not been occupied for many years; the kansamah looked
      like a gray-bearded skeleton compressed within a tightened shroud of
      parchment skin that shone where a coffin or a tomb had touched it. He
      seemed to have forgotten what the bungalow was for, or that a sahib needed
      things to eat, until the ex-risaldar enlightened him, and then he
      complained wheezily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stables&mdash;rather the patch-and-hole-covered desolation that once
      had been stables&mdash;were altogether too snake-defiled and smelly to be
      worth repairing; the string of horses was quartered cleanly and snugly
      under tents, and Mahommed Gunga went to enormous trouble in arranging a
      ring of watch-fires at even distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there thieves here, then?&rdquo; asked Cunningham, and the Rajput nodded
      but said nothing. He seemed satisfied, though, that the man he had brought
      safely thus far at so much trouble would be well enough housed in the
      creaky wreck of the bungalow, and he took no precautions of any kind as to
      guarding its approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham watched the preparations for his supper with ill-concealed
      disgust&mdash;saw the customary chase of a rubber-muscled chicken, heard
      its death gurgles, saw the guts removed, to make sure that the kansamah
      did not cook it with that part of its anatomy intact, as he surely would
      do unless watched&mdash;and then strolled ahead a little way along the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fakir was squatting in the distance, on a big white stone, and in the
      quiet of the gloaming Cunningham could hear his coarse, lewd voice tossing
      crumbs of abuse and mockery to the seven or eight villagers who squatted
      near him&mdash;half-amused, half-frightened, and altogether credulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he drew nearer Cunningham could not understand a word of what the
      fakir said, but the pantomime was obvious. His was the voice and the
      manner of the professional beggar who has no more need to whine but still
      would ingratiate. It was the bullying, brazen swagger and the voice that
      traffics in filth and impudence instead of wit; and, in payment for his
      evening bellyful he was pouring out abuse of Cunningham that grew viler
      and yet viler as Cunningham came nearer and the fakir realized that his
      subject could not understand a word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villagers looked leery and eyed Cunningham sideways at each fresh
      sally. The fakir grew bolder, until one of his listeners smothered an open
      laugh in both hands and rolled over sideways. Cunningham came closer yet,
      half-enamoured of the weird scene, half-curious to discover what the stone
      could be on which the fakir sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fakir grew nervous. Perhaps, after all, this was one of those
      hatefully clever sahibs who know enough to pretend they do not know! The
      abuse and vile innuendo changed to more obsequious, less obviously filthy
      references to other things than Cunningham's religion, likes, and
      pedigree, and the little crowd of men who had tacitly encouraged him
      before got ready now to stand at a distance and take sides against him
      should the white man turn out to have understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cunningham happened to catch sight of a cloud of paroquets that swept
      in a screaming ellipse for a better branch to nest in and added the one
      touch of gorgeous color needed to make the whole scene utterly unearthly
      and unlike anything he had ever dreamed of, or had seen in pictures, or
      had had described to him. He stood at gaze&mdash;forgetful of the stone
      that had attracted him and of the fakir&mdash;spellbound by the
      wonder-blend of hues branch-backed, and framed in gloom as the birds'
      scream was framed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, seeing him at gaze, the fakir recovered confidence and jeered new
      ribaldry, until some one suddenly shot out from behind Cunningham, and
      before he had recovered from his surprise he saw the fakir sprawling on
      his back, howling for mercy, while Mahommed Gunga beat the blood out of
      him with a whalebone riding-whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun went down with Indian suddenness and shut off the scene of
      upraised lash and squirming, naked, ash-smeared devil, as a magic-lantern
      picture; disappears. Only the creature's screams reverberated through the
      jungle, like a belated echo to the restless paroquets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will sleep less easily for a week or two!&rdquo; hazarded Mahommed Gunga,
      stepping back toward Cunningham. In the sudden darkness the white breeches
      showed and the whites of his eyes, but little else; his voice growled like
      a rumble from the underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do it, risaldar? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was enough, bahadur, that he sat on that stone; for that alone he had
      been beaten! What he said was but the babbling of priests. All priests are
      alike. They have a common jargon&mdash;a common disrespect for what they
      dare not openly defy. These temple rats of fakirs mimic them. That is all,
      sahib. A whipping meets the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the stone? Why shouldn't he sit on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one minute, sahib, and then see.&rdquo; He formed his hands into a trumpet
      and bellowed through them in a high-pitched, nasal, ululating order to
      somebody behind:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h&mdash;Battee-lao!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black, dark roadside echoed it and a dot of light leapt up as a man
      came running with what gradually grew into a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga seized the lamp, bent for a few seconds over the still
      sprawling fakir, whipped him again twice, cursed him and kicked him, until
      he got up and ran like a spectre for the gloom beyond the trees. Then,
      with a rather stately sweep of the lamp, and a tremble in his voice that
      was probably intentional&mdash;designed to make Cunningham at least aware
      of the existence of emotion before he looked&mdash;he let the light fall
      on the slab on which the fakir had been squatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Cunningham-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youngster bent down above the slab and tried, in the fitful light, to
      make out what the markings were that ran almost from side to side, in
      curves, across the stone; but it was too dark&mdash;the light was too
      fitful; the marks themselves were too faint from the constant squatting of
      roadside wanderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga set the lamp down on the stone, and he and the attendant
      took little sticks, sharp-pointed, with which they began to dig hurriedly,
      scratching and scraping at what presently showed, even in that rising and
      falling light, as Roman lettering. Soon Cunningham himself began to lend a
      hand. He made out a date first, and he could feel it with his fingers
      before his eyes deciphered it. Gradually, letter by letter&mdash;word by
      word&mdash;he read it off, feeling a strange new thrill run through him,
      as each line followed, like a voice from the haunted past.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    A.D. 1823. A.D.
    SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL ROBERT FRANCIS CUNNINGHAM
    WHO DIED ON THIS SPOT
    AETAT 81
    FROM
    WOUNDS INFLICTED BY A
    TIGER
</pre>
    <p>
      There was no sound audible except the purring of the lamp flame and the
      heavy breathing of the three as Cunningham gazed down at the very crudely
      carved, stained, often-desecrated slab below which lay the first of the
      Anglo-Indian Cunninghams.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man&mdash;these crumbled bones that lay under a forgotten piece of
      rock&mdash;had made all of their share of history. They had begotten
      &ldquo;Pukka&rdquo; Cunningham, who had hacked the name deeper yet in the crisscrossed
      annals of a land of war. It was strange&mdash;it was queer&mdash;uncanny&mdash;for
      the third of the Cunninghams to be sitting on the stone. It was
      unexpected, yet it seemed to have a place in the scheme of things, for he
      caught himself searching his memory backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received an impression that something was expected of him. He knew, by
      instinct and reasoning he could not have explained, that neither Mahommed
      Gunga nor the other men would say a word until he spoke. They were waiting&mdash;he
      knew they were&mdash;for a word, or a sign, or an order (he did not know
      which), on which would hang the future of all three of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was no hurry&mdash;no earthly hurry. He felt sure of it. In the
      silence and the blackness&mdash;in the tense, steamy atmosphere of
      expectancy&mdash;he felt perfectly at ease, although he knew, too, that
      there was superstition to be reckoned with&mdash;and that is something
      which a white man finds hard to weigh and cope with, as a rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweat ran down his face in little streams a the prickly heat began to
      move across his skin, like a fiery-footed centiped beneath his undershirt,
      but he noticed, neither. He began to be unconscious anything except the
      knowledge that the bones of his grandsire lay underneath him and that
      Mahommed Gunga waited for the word that would fit into the scheme and
      solve a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any tigers here now?&rdquo; he asked presently, in a perfectly normal
      voice. He spoke as he had done when his servant asked him which suit he
      would wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib! Many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man-eaters, by any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga and the other man exchanged quick glances, but Cunningham
      did not look up. He did not see the quick-flashed whites as their eyes met
      and looked down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one, sahib&mdash;so say the kansamah and the head man&mdash;a
      full-grown tiger, in his prime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will shoot him.&rdquo; Four words, said quietly&mdash;not &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;I would like to,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; They were perfectly definite and without
      a trace of excitement; yet this man had never seen a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sahib.&rdquo; That, too, was spoken in a level voice, but Mahommed
      Gunga's eyes and the other man's met once again above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will stay here four days; by the third day there will be time enough
      to have brought an elephant and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go on foot,&rdquo; said Cunningham, quite quietly. &ldquo;Tomorrow, at dawn,
      risaldar-sahib. Will you be good enough to make arrangements? All we need
      to know is where he is and how to get there&mdash;will you attend to
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I wonder if my supper's ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and walked away, with a little salute-like movement of his hand
      that was reminiscent of his father. The two Rajputs watched him in
      heavy-breathing silence until the little group of lights, where the
      horse-tents faced the old dak-bungalow, swallowed him. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is good. He will do!&rdquo; said the black-beard who had brought the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is good. But many sahibs would have acted coolly, thus. There must be
      a greater test. There must be no doubt&mdash;no littlest doubt. Alwa and
      the others will ask me on my honor, and I will answer on my honor, yes or
      no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an hour before the two of them returned, and looked the horses over
      and strolled up to bid Cunningham good night; and in the meanwhile they
      had seen about the morrow's tiger, and another matter.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    What found ye, then? Why heated ye the pot?
            What useful metal down the channels ran?
    Gold?  Steel for making weapons?  Iron?  What?
            Nay. Out from the fire we kindled strode a man!
</pre>
    <p>
      THEY set the legs of Cunningham's string-woven bed into pans of water, to
      keep the scorpions and ants and snakes at bay, and then left him in pitch
      darkness to his own devices, with a parting admonition to keep his
      slippers on for the floor, in the dark, would be the prowling-place of
      venomed death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was he who set the lamp on the little table by his bedside, for his
      servant&mdash;for the first time on that journey&mdash;was not at hand to
      execute his thoughts almost before he had spoken them. Mahommed Gunga had
      explained that the man was sick; and that seemed strange, for he had been
      well enough, and more than usually efficient, but an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were stranger things and far more irritating ones to interfere
      with the peaceful passage of the night. There were sounds that were
      unaccountable; there was the memory of the wayside tombstone and the train
      of thought that it engendered. Added to the hell-hot, baking stuffiness
      that radiated from the walls, there came the squeaking of a punka rope
      pulled out of time&mdash;the piece of piping in the mud-brick wall through
      which the rope passed had become clogged and rusted, and the villager
      pressed into service had forgotten how to pull; he jerked at the cord
      between nods as the heat of the veranda and the unaccustomed night duty
      combined to make him sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the squeaking became intolerable, and Cunningham swore at him&mdash;in
      English, because he spoke little of any native language yet, and had not
      the least idea in any case what the punka-wallah's tongue might be. For a
      while after that the pulling was more even; he lay on one elbow, letting
      the swinging mat fan just miss his ear, and examining his rifle and
      pistols for lack of anything better to keep him from going mad. Then,
      suddenly, the pulling ceased altogether. Silence and hell heat shut down
      on him like a coffin lid. Even the lamp flame close beside him seemed to
      grow dim; the weight of black night that was suffocating him seemed to
      crush light out of the flame as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      No living mortal could endure that, he imagined. He swore aloud, but there
      was no answer, so he got up, after crashing his rifle-butt down on the
      floor to scare away anything that crawled. For a moment he stood,
      undecided whether to take the lamp or rifle with him&mdash;then decided on
      the rifle, for the lamp might blow out in some unexpected night gust,
      whereas if he left it where it was it would go on burning and show him the
      way back to bed again. Besides, he was too unaccustomed to the joy of
      owning the last new thing in sporting rifles to hesitate for long about
      what to keep within his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open door he could see nothing but pitch-blackness,
      unpunctuated even by a single star. There were no lights where the tents
      stood, so he judged that even the accustomed natives had found the added
      heat of Mahommed Gunga's watch-fires intolerable and had raked them out;
      but from where he imagined that the village must be came the
      dum-tu-dum-tu-dum of tom-toms, like fever blood pulsating in the veins of
      devils of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punka-wallah slept. He could just make out the man's blurred shape&mdash;a
      shadow in the shadows&mdash;dog-curled, with the punkah rope looped round
      his foot. He kicked him gently, and the man stirred, but fell asleep
      again. He kicked him harder. The man sat up and stared, terrified; the
      whites of his eyes were distinctly visible. He seemed to have forgotten
      why he was there, and to imagine that he saw a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham spoke to him&mdash;he first words that came into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on pulling,&rdquo; he said in English, quite kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he had loosed his rifle off, the effect could not have been more
      instantaneous. Clutching his twisted rag of a turban in one hand, and
      kicking his leg free, he ran for it&mdash;leaped the veranda rail, and
      vanished&mdash;a night shadow, swallowed by its mother night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; called Cunningham. &ldquo;Iderao! I won't hurt you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was no answer, save the tom-toms' thunder, swelling now into a
      devil's chorus-coming nearer. It seemed to be coming from the forest, but
      he reasoned that it could not be; it must be some village marriage feast,
      or perhaps an orgy; he had paid out what would seem to the villagers a lot
      of money, and it might be that they were celebrating the occasion. It was
      strange, though, that he could see no lights where the village ought to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he had a half-formed intention to shout for Mahommed Gunga;
      but he checked that, reasoning that the Rajput might think he was afraid.
      Then his eye caught sight of something blacker than the shadows&mdash;something
      long and thin and creepy that moved, and he remembered that bed, where the
      pans of water would protect him, was the only safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he returned into the hot, black silence where the tiny lamp-flame
      guttered and threw shadows. He wondered why it guttered. It seemed to be
      actually short of air. There were four rooms, he remembered, to the
      bungalow, all connected and each opening outward by a door that faced one
      of the four sides; he wondered whether the outer doors were opened to
      admit a draught, and started to investigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of them were shut tight, and he could not kick them open; the
      dried-out teak and the heavy iron bolts held as though they had been built
      to resist a siege; the noise that he made as he rattled at them frightened
      a swarm of unseen things&mdash;unguessed-at shapes&mdash;that scurried
      away. He thought he could see beady little eyes that looked and
      disappeared and circled round and stopped to look again. He could hear
      creepy movements in the stillness. It seemed better to leave those doors
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other door, which faced that of his own room, was open wide, and he
      could feel the forest through it; there was nothing to be seen, but the
      stillness moved. The velvet blackness was deeper by a shade, and the heat,
      uprising to get even with the sky, bore up a stench with it. There was no
      draught, no movement except upward. Earth was panting-in time, it seemed,
      to the hellish thunder of the tom-toms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back and lay on the bed again, leaning the rifle against the
      cot-frame, and trying by sheer will-power to prevent the blood from
      bursting his veins. He realized before long that he was parched with
      thirst, and reached out for the water-jar that stood beside the lamp; but
      as he started to drink he realized that a crawling evil was swimming round
      and round in rings in the water. In a fit of horror he threw the thing
      away and smashed it into a dozen fragments in a corner. He saw a dozen
      rats, at least, scamper to drink before the water could evaporate or
      filter through the floor; and when they were gone there was no
      half-drowned crawling thing either. They had eaten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clutched his rifle to him. The barrel was hot, but the feel of it gave
      him a sense of companionship. And then, as he lay back on the bed again,
      the lamp went out. He groped for it and shook it. There was no oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what had been hot horror turned to fear that passed all understanding&mdash;to
      the hate that does not reason&mdash;to the cold sweat breaking on the
      roasted skin. Where the four walls had been there was blackness of
      immeasurable space. He could hear the thousand-footed cannibals of night
      creep nearer&mdash;driven in toward him by the dinning of the tom-toms. He
      felt that his bed was up above a scrambling swarm of black-legged things
      that fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no idea how long he lay stock-still, for fear of calling attention
      to himself, and hated his servant and Mahommed Gunga and all India. Once&mdash;twice&mdash;he
      thought he heard another sound, almost like the footfall of a man on the
      veranda near him. Once he thought that a man breathed within ten paces of
      him, and for a moment there was a distinct sensation of not being alone.
      He hoped it was true; he could deal with an assassin. That would be
      something tangible to hate and hit. Manhood came to his assistance&mdash;the
      spirit of the soldier that will bow to nothing that has shape; but it died
      away again as the creeping silence once more shut down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the thunder of the tom-toms ceased. Then even the venomed
      crawlers that he knew were near him faded into nothing that really
      mattered, compared to the greater, stealthy horror that he knew was
      coming, born of the shuddersome, shut silence that ensued. There was
      neither air nor view&mdash;no sense of time or space&mdash;nothing but the
      coal-black pit of terror yawning&mdash;cold sweat in the heat, and a
      footfall&mdash;an undoubted footfall&mdash;followed by another one, too
      heavy for a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where heavy feet were there was something tangible. His veins tingled and
      the cold sweat dried. Excitement began to reawaken all his soldier senses,
      and the wish to challenge seized him&mdash;the soldierly intent to warn
      the unaware, which is the actual opposite of cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! Who comes there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lipped the words, but his dry throat would not voice them. Before he
      could clear his throat or wet his lips his eye caught something lighter
      than the night&mdash;two things&mdash;ten&mdash;twelve paces off&mdash;two
      things that glowed or sheened as though there were light inside them&mdash;too
      big and too far apart to be owl's eyes, but singularly like them. They
      moved, a little sideways and toward him; and again he heard the heavy,
      stealthy footfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed still then for what may have been a minute, and another sense&mdash;smell&mdash;warned
      him and stirred up the man in him. He had never smelled it in his life; it
      must have been instinct that assured him of an enemy behind the strange,
      unpleasant, rather musky reek that filled the room. His right hand brought
      the rifle to his shoulder without sound, and almost without conscious
      effort on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot the heat now and the silence and discomfort. He lay still on his
      side, squinting down the rifle barrel at a spot he judged was midway
      between a pair of eyes that glowed, and wondering where his foresight
      might be. It struck him all at once that it was quite impossible to see
      the foresight&mdash;that he must actually touch what he would hit if he
      would be at all sure of hitting it. He remembered, too, in that instant&mdash;as
      a born soldier does remember things&mdash;that in the dark an attacking
      enemy is probably more frightened than his foe. His father had told it him
      when he was a little lad afraid of bogies; he in turn had told it to the
      other boys at school, and they had passed it on until in that school it
      had become rule number one of school-boy lore&mdash;just as rule number
      two in all schools where the sons of soldiers go is &ldquo;Take the fight to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped from the bed, with his rifle out in front of him&mdash;white-nightshirted
      and unexpected&mdash;sudden enough to scare the wits out of anything that
      had them. He was met by a snarl. The two eyes narrowed, and then blazed.
      They lowered, as though their owner gathered up his weight to spring. He
      fired between them. The flash and the smoke blinded him; the burst of the
      discharge within four echoing walls deadened his cars, and he was aware of
      nothing but a voice beside him that said quietly: &ldquo;Well done, bahadur!
      Thou art thy father's son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his rifle butt to the floor, and some one struck a light. Even
      then it was thirty seconds before his strained eyes grew accustomed to the
      flare and he could see the tiger at his feet, less than a yard away&mdash;dead,
      bleeding, wide-eyed, obviously taken by surprise and shot as he prepared
      to spring. Beside him, within a yard, Mahommed Gunga stood, with a drawn
      sabre in his right hand and a pistol in his left, and there were three
      other men standing like statues by the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; demanded Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A half-hour, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case of need, sahib. That tiger killed a woman yesterday at dawn and
      was driven off his kill; he was not likely to be an easy mark for an
      untried hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you enter without knocking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-risaldar said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you have shoes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scorpions, sahib&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be pleased, Mahommed Gunga, if I entered your house with my hat
      on and without knocking or without permission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good enough to have that brute's carcass dragged out and skinned, and&mdash;ah&mdash;leave
      me to sleep, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga bowed, and growled an order; another man passed the order
      on, and the tom-tom thundering began again as a dozen villagers pattered
      in to take away the tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them, please,&rdquo; commanded Cunningham, &ldquo;that that racket is to cease.
      I want to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mahommed Gunga bowed, without a smile or a tremor on his face; again
      a growled order was echoed and re-echoed through the dark. The drumming
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there oil in the bahadur's lamp?&rdquo; asked Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; said Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will command that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't trouble, thank you, risaldar-sahib. I sleep better in the
      dark. I'll be glad to see you after breakfast as usual&mdash;ah&mdash;without
      your shoes, unless you come in uniform. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput signed to the others and withdrew with dignity. Cunningham
      reloaded his rifle in the dark and lay down. Within five minutes the
      swinging of the punka and the squeaking of the rope resumed, but regularly
      this time; Mahommed Gunga had apparently unearthed a man who understood
      the business. Reaction, the intermittent coolth, as the mat fan swung
      above his face, the steady, evenly timed squeak and movement&mdash;not
      least, the calm of well-asserted dignity&mdash;all joined to have one way,
      and Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur slept, to dream of fire-eyed tigers dancing on
      tombstones laid on the roof of hell, and of a grandfather in full
      general's uniform, who said: &ldquo;Well done, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But outside, by a remade camp-fire, Mahommed Gunga sat and chuckled to
      himself, and every now and then grew eloquent to the bearded men who sat
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aie! Did you hear him reprimand me? By the beard of God's prophet, that
      is a man of men! So was his father! Now I will tell Alwa and the others
      that I bring a man to them! By the teeth of God and my own honor I will
      swear to it! His first tiger&mdash;he had never seen a tiger!&mdash;in the
      dark, and unexpected&mdash;caught by it, to all seeming, like a trapped
      man in a cage&mdash;no lamp&mdash;no help at hand, or so he thought until
      it was all over. And he ran at the tiger! And then, 'you come with your
      shoes on, Mahommed Gunga&mdash;why, forsooth?' Did you hear him? By the
      blood of Allah, we have a man to lead us!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Now, the gist of the thing is&mdash;Be silent.  Be calm.
            Be awake.  Be on hand on the day.
    Be instant to heed the first note of alarm.
            And&mdash;precisely&mdash;exactly&mdash;Obey.
</pre>
    <p>
      AT Howrah, while Mahommed Gunga was employing each chance circumstance to
      test the pluck and decision and reliability of Cunningham at almost every
      resting-place along the Grand Trunk Road, the armed squire he had left
      behind with a little handful of gold mohurs and three horses was finding
      time heavy on his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his master, Ali Partab was a man of action, to whom the purlieus of a
      caravansary were well enough on rare occasions. He could ruffle it with
      the best of them; like any of his race, he could lounge with dignity and
      listen to the tales that hum wherever many horsemen congregate; and he was
      no mean raconteur&mdash;he had a tale or two to tell himself, of women and
      the chase and of the laugh that he, too, had flung in the teeth of fear
      when opportunity arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But each new story of the paid taletellers, who squat and drone and reach
      a climax, and then pass the begging bowl before they finish it&mdash;each
      merrily related jest brought in by members of the constantly arriving
      trading parties&mdash;each neigh of his three chargers&mdash;every new
      phase of the kaleidoscopic life he watched stirred new ambition in him to
      be up, and away, and doing. Many a dozen times he had to remind himself
      that &ldquo;there had been a trust imposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He exercised the horses daily, riding each in turn until he was as lean
      and lithe and hard beneath the skin as they were. They were Mahommed
      Gunga's horses&mdash;he Mahommed Gunga's man; therefore, his honor was
      involved. He reasoned, when he took the trouble to, along the good clean
      feudal line that lays down clearly what service is: there is no honor,
      says that argument, in serving any one who is content with half a service,
      and the honor is the only thing that counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As day succeeded ever sultrier, ever longer-drawn-out day&mdash;as each
      night came that saw him peg the horses out wherever what little breezes
      moved might fan them&mdash;as he sat among the courtyard groups and
      listened in the heavy heat, the fact grew more apparent to him that this
      trust of his was something after all which a man of worth might shoulder
      proudly. There was danger in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk among the traders&mdash;darkly hinted, most of it, and couched in
      metaphor&mdash;was all of blood, and what would follow on the letting of
      it. Now and then a loud-mouthed boaster would throw caution to the winds
      and speak openly of a grim day coming for the British; he would be checked
      instantly by wiser men, but not before Ali Partab had heard enough to add
      to his private store of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests came from a dozen cities to the eastward, all nominally after
      pilgrims for the sacred places, but all strangely indifferent to their
      quest. They preferred, it would seem, to sit in rings with chance-met
      ruffians&mdash;with believers and unbelievers alike&mdash;even with men of
      no caste at all&mdash;and talk of other things than pilgrimages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next year, one hundred years ago the English conquered India. Remember ye
      the prophecy? One hundred years they had! This, then, is the last year.
      Whom the gods would whelm they first deprive of reason; mark ye this! The
      cartridges they serve out to the sepoys now are smeared with the blended
      fat of cows and pigs. Knowing that we Hindoos hold the cow a sacred beast,
      they do this sacrilege&mdash;and why? They would make us bite the
      cartridges and lose our caste. And why again? Because they would make us
      Christians! That is the truth! Else why are the Christian missionaries
      here in Howrah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The listeners would nod while the little red fires glowed and purred above
      the pipes, and others not included in the circle strained forward through
      the dark to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gods get ready now! Are ye ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsewhere, a hadji&mdash;green-turbaned from the pilgrimage to Mecca&mdash;would
      hold out to a throng of true believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! Pig's fat on the cartridges! The new drill is that the sepoy bites
      the cartridge first, to spill a little powder and make priming. Which true
      believer wishes to defile himself with pig's fat? Why do they this? Why
      are the Christian missionaries here? Ask both riddles with one breath, for
      both two are one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slay, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up now, and slay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There would be an instant, eager restlessness, while Ali Partab would
      glance over to where the horses stood, and would wonder why the word that
      loosed him was so long in coming. The hadji would calm his listeners and
      tell them to get ready, but be still and await the sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were to be one hundred years, ran the prophecy; but ninety-nine and
      a portion have yet run. Wait for the hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for perhaps the hundredth time, Ali Partab would pretend that
      movement alone could save one or other of his horses from heat apoplexy.
      He would mount, and ride at a walking pace through the streets that seemed
      like a night view of a stricken battle-field, turn down by the palace
      wall, and then canter to the schoolhouse, where the hag&mdash;wiser than
      her mistress&mdash;would be sleeping in the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou! Mother of a murrain! Toothless one! Is there no word yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hag would leer up through the heavy darkness&mdash;make certain that
      he had no lance with him with which to prod her in the ribs&mdash;scratch
      herself a time or two like a stray dog half awakened&mdash;and then leer
      knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou the gold mohurs?&rdquo; she would demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a sieve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let my old eyes see them, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would take out two gold coins and hold them out in such a way that she
      could look at them without the opportunity to snatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no word yet,&rdquo; she would answer, when her eyes had feasted on
      them as long as his patience would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they no fear then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. Only madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that they bite thee not! Keep thy wits with thee, and be ready to
      bring me word in time, else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, sahib! Show me the coins again&mdash;one little look&mdash;again
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ali Partab would wheel and ride away, leaving her to mumble and gibber
      in the road and curl again on to her blanket in the blackest corner by the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, on an expedition of that kind, he encountered Duncan McClean
      himself. The lean, tall Scotsman, gray-headed from the cares he had taken
      on himself, a little bowed from heat and hopelessness, but showing no
      least symptom of surrender in the kind, strong lines of a rugged face,
      stood, eyes upward, in the moonlight. The moon, at least, looked cool. It
      was at the full, like a disk of silver, and he seemed to drink in the
      beams that bathed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he worship it?&rdquo; wondered Ali Partab, reining from an amble to a walk
      and watching half-reverently. The followers of Mohammed are most
      superstitious about the moon. The feeling that he had for this man of
      peace who could so gaze up at it was something very like respect, and,
      with the twenty-second sense that soldiers have, he knew, without a word
      spoken or a deed seen done, that this would be a wielder of cold steel to
      be reckoned should he ever slough the robes of peace and take it into his
      silvered head to fight. The Rajput, that respects decision above all other
      virtues, perhaps because it is the one that he most lacks, could sense
      firm, unshakable, quick-seized determination on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duncan McClean acknowledged the fierce-seeming stare with a salute, and
      Ali Partab dismounted instantly. He who holds a trust from such as
      Mahommed Gunga is polite in recognition of the trust. He leaned, then,
      against the horse's withers, wondering how far he ought to let politeness
      go and whether his honor bade him show contempt for the Christian's creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any way, I wonder,&rdquo; asked the Scotsman, the clean-clipped
      suspicion of Scots dialect betraying itself even through the Hindustanee
      that he used, &ldquo;of getting letters through to some small station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said the Rajput.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a Mohammedan?&rdquo; The Scotsman peered at him, adjusting his
      viewpoint to the moon's rays. &ldquo;I see you are. A Rajput, too, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a Rangar here not very long ago.&rdquo; This man evidently knew the
      proper title to give a he true believer of the proudest race there is. Ali
      Partab's heart began to go out to him&mdash;&ldquo;an officer, I think, once of
      the Rajput Horse, who very kindly carried letters for me. Perhaps you know
      of some other gentleman of your race about to travel northward? He could
      earn, at least, gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-ho!&rdquo; thought Ali Partab to himself. &ldquo;I have known men of his race who
      would have offered money, to be spat on!&mdash;Not now, sahib,&rdquo; he
      answered aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahommed Gunga was the officer's name. Do you know him, or know of him,
      by any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib, I know him well. It is an honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Scotsman smiled. &ldquo;He must be very far away by this time. How many are
      there, I wonder, in India who have such things said of them when their
      backs are turned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than a few, sahib! I would draw steel for the good name of more than
      a hundred men whom I know, and there be many others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men of your own race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no bombast in the man's voice; it was said good-naturedly, as a
      man might say, &ldquo;There are some friends to whom I would lend money.&rdquo; No man
      with any insight could mistake the truth that underlay the boast. The
      Scotsman bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, indeed, to have met you. Will you sit down a little while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib. The hour is late. I was but keeping the blood moving in this
      horse of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell me, since you won't stay, have you any notion who the man was
      whom Mahommed Gunga sent to get my letters? My daughter handed them to him
      one evening, late, at this door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am he, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;I understood&mdash;perhaps I was mistaken&mdash;I thought it
      was his man who came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praised be Allah, I am his man, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wonder whether my servants praise God for the privilege!&rdquo; McClean
      made the remark only half-aloud and in English. Ali Partab could not have
      understood the words, but he may have caught their meaning, for he glanced
      sideways at the old hag mumbling in the shadow and grinned into his beard.
      &ldquo;Are you in communication with him? Could you get a letter to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no slightest notion where he is, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my letters could once reach him, wherever he might be, I would feel
      confident of their arriving at their destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent one letter&mdash;to a government official. It cannot have reached
      him, for there should have been an answer and none has come. It had
      reference to this terrible suttee business. Suttee is against the law as
      well as against all dictates of reason and humanity; yet the Hindoos make
      a constant practice of it here under our very eyes. These native states
      are under treaty to observe the law. I intend to do all in my power to put
      a stop to their ghoulish practices, and Maharajah Howrah knows what my
      intentions are. It must be a Mohammedan, this time, to whom I intrust my
      correspondence on suttee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, a Rangar is a man whose ancestors were Hindoos but who became
      converts to Islam. Like all proselytes, they adhere more enthusiastically
      to their religion than do the men whose mother creed it is; and the fact
      that the Rangars originally became converts under duress is often thrown
      in their teeth by the Hindoos, who gain nothing in the way of brotherly
      regard in the process. A Rangar hates a Hindoo as enthusiastically as he
      loves a fight. Ali Partab began to drum his fingers on his teeth and to
      exhibit less impatience to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no knowing, sahib. I, too, am no advocate of superstitious
      practices involving cruelty. I might get a letter through. My commission
      from the risaldar-sahib would include all honorable matters not
      obstructive to the main issue. I have certain funds&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have funds,&rdquo; smiled the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not allowed, sahib, to involve myself in any brawl until after my
      business is accomplished. It would be necessary first to assure me on that
      point. My honor is involved in that matter. To whom, and of what nature,
      would the letter be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter to the Company's Resident at Abu, reporting to him that Hindoo
      widows are still compelled in this city to burn themselves to death above
      their husbands' funeral pyres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput grinned. &ldquo;Does the Resident sahib not know it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no chance of his not knowing should my report reach him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see, sahib, what can be done, then, in the matter. If I can find a
      man, I will bring him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary thanked him and stood watching as the Rajput rode away.
      When the horseman's free, lean back had vanished in the inky darkness his
      eyes wandered over to a point where tongues of flame licked upward,
      casting a dull, dancing, crimson glow on the hot sky. Here and there,
      silhouetted in the firelight, he could see the pugrees and occasional long
      poles of men who prodded at the embers. Ululating through the din of
      tom-toms he could catch the wails of women. He shuddered, prayed a little,
      and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day even the little bazaar fosterlings, whom he had begged, and
      coaxed, and taught, had all deserted to be present at the burning of three
      widows. Even the lepers in the tiny hospital that he had started had
      limped out for a distant view. He had watched a year's work all
      disintegrating in a minute at the call of bestial, loathsome, blood-hungry
      superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was a man of iron, as Christian missionaries go. He had been
      hard-bitten in his youth and trained in a hard, grim school. In the Isle
      of Skye he had seen the little cabin where his mother lived pulled down to
      make more room for a fifty-thousand-acre deer-forest. He had seen his
      mother beg.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had worked his way to Edinburgh, toiled at starvation wages for the
      sake of leave to learn at night, burned midnight oil, and failed at the
      end of it, through ill health, to pass for his degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had loved as only hard-hammered men can love, and had married after a
      struggle the very thought of which would have melted the courage of an
      ordinary man, only to see his wife die when her child was born. And even
      then, in that awful hour, he had not felt the utterness of misery such as
      came to him when he saw that his work in Howrah was undone. He had given
      of his best, and all his best, and it seemed that he had given it for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man, father?&rdquo; asked a very weary voice through which courage
      seemed to live yet, as the tiniest suspicion of a sweet refrain still
      lives through melancholy bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who took your home letters to Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has promised to try to find a man for me who will take my report on
      this awful business to the Resident at Abu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, listen! Listen, please!&rdquo; Rosemary McClean drew a chair for him
      and knelt beside him. Youth saved her face from being drawn as his, but
      the heat and horror had begun to undermine youth's powers of resistance.
      She looked more beautiful than ever, but no law lays down that a wraith
      shall be unlovely. She had tried the personal appeal with him a hundred
      times, and argument a thousand; now, she used both in a concentrated,
      earnest effort to prevail over his stubborn will. Her will was as strong
      as his, and yielded place to nothing but her sense of loyalty. There were
      not only Rajputs, as the Rajputs knew, who could be true to a high ideal.
      &ldquo;I am sure that whoever that man is he must be the link between us and the
      safety Mahommed Gunga spoke of. Otherwise, why does he stay behind? Native
      officers who have servants take their servants with them, as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the word! Let us at least get in touch with safety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, no. For you, yes! I have been weak with you, dear. I have let
      my selfish pleasure in having you near me overcome my sense of duty&mdash;that,
      and my faithless fear that you would not be properly provided for. I
      think, too, that I have never quite induced myself to trust natives
      sufficiently&mdash;even native gentlemen. You shall go, Rosemary. You
      shall go as soon as I can get word to Mahommed Gunga's man. Call that old
      woman in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I will not go without you, and you know it! My place is with you,
      and I have quite made up my mind. If you stay, I stay! My presence here
      has saved your life a hundred times over. No, I don't mean just when you
      were ill; I mean that they dare not lay a finger on me! They know that a
      nation which respects their women would strike hard and swiftly to avenge
      a woman of its own! If I were to go away and leave you they would poison
      you or stab you within a day, and then hold a mock trial and hang some
      innocent or other to blind the British Government. I would be a murderess
      if I left you here alone! Come! Come away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;It was wrong of me to ever bring you here,&rdquo; he said
      sadly. &ldquo;But I did not know&mdash;I would never have believed.&rdquo; Then wrath
      took hold of him&mdash;the awful, cold anger of the Puritan that hates
      evil as a concrete thing, to be ripped apart with steel. &ldquo;God's wrath
      shall burst on Howrah!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Sodom and Gomorrah were no worse!
      Remember what befell them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember Lot!&rdquo; said Rosemary. &ldquo;Come away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lot stayed on to the last, and tried to warn them! I will warn the
      Resident! Here, give me my writing things&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed her aside, none too gently, for the fire of a Covenanter's anger
      was blazing in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are forty thousand British soldiers standing still, and wrong&mdash;black,
      shameful wrong&mdash;is being done! For a matter of gold&mdash;for fear of
      the cost in filthy lucre&mdash;they refrain from hurling wrong-doers in
      the dust! For the sake of dishonorable peace they leave these native
      states to misgovern themselves and stink to high heaven! Will God allow
      what they do? The shame and the sin is on England's head! Her statesmen
      shut their eyes and cry 'Peace, peace!' where there is no peace. Her queen
      sits idle on the throne while widows burn, screaming, in the flames of
      superstitious priests. Men tell her, 'All is well; there is British rule
      in India!' They are too busy robbing widows in the Isle of Skye to lend an
      ear to the cries of India's widows! Corruption&mdash;superstition&mdash;murder&mdash;lies&mdash;black
      wrong&mdash;black selfishness&mdash;all growing rank beneath the shadow of
      the British rule&mdash;how long will God let that last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pacing up and down like a caged lion, not looking at Rosemary, not
      speaking to her&mdash;speaking to himself, and giving rein to all the
      rankling rage at wrong that wrong had nurtured in him since his boyhood.
      She knelt still by the chair, her eyes following him as he raged up and
      down the matted floor. She pitied him more than she did India.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he took the one lamp at last and set it where the light would fall
      above his writing pad, she left the room and went to stand at the
      street-door, where the sluggish night air was a degree less stifling than
      in the mud-plastered, low-ceilinged room. As she stood there, one hand on
      either door-post to remind her she was living in a concrete world, not a
      charred whisp swaying in the heat, a black thing rose out of the
      blackness, and the toothless hag held out a bony hand and touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not time yet for the word to go?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No word yet, Joanna.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Now, God give good going to master o' mine,
            God speed him, and lead him, and nerve him;
    God give him a lead of a length in the line,
            And,&mdash;God let him boast that I serve him!
</pre>
    <p>
      THE dawn was barely breaking yet when things stirred in the little mission
      house. The flea-bitten gray pony was saddled by a sleepy saice, and
      brought round from his open-sided thatch stable in the rear. The violet
      and mauve, that precede the aching yellow glare of day were fading; a
      coppersmith began his everlasting bong-bong-bong, apparently reverberating
      from every direction; the last, almost indetectable, warm whiff of night
      wind moved and died away, and the monkeys in the near-by baobab chattered
      it a requiem. Almost on the stroke of sunrise Rosemary McClean stepped out&mdash;settled
      her sun-helmet, with a moue above the chin-strap that was wasted on
      flat-bosomed, black grandmotherdom and sulky groom&mdash;and mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She needed no help. The pony stood as though he knew that the hot wind
      would soon dry the life out of him; and, though dark rings beneath dark
      eyes betrayed the work of heat and sleepless worry on a girl who should
      have graced the cool, sweet, rain-swept hills of Scotland, she had spirit
      left yet and an unspent store of youth. The saice seemed more weathered
      than the twenty-year-old girl, for he limped back into the smelly shelter
      of the servants' quarters to cook his breakfast and mumble about dogs and
      sahibs who prefer the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked shrunk inside the riding-habit&mdash;not shrivelled, for she
      sat too straight, but as though the cotton jacket had been made for a
      larger woman. If she seemed tired, and if a stranger might have guessed
      that her head ached until the chestnut curls were too heavy for it, she
      was still supple. And, as she whipped the pony into an unwilling trot and
      old mission-named Joanna broke into a jog behind, revolt&mdash;no longer
      impatience, or discontent, or sorrow, but reckless rebellion&mdash;rode
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there, plain for the world to see, in the firm lines of a little
      Puritan mouth, in the angle of a high-held chin in the set of a gallant
      little pair of shoulders. The pony felt it, and leaned forward to a
      canter. Joanna scented, smelt, or sensed in some manner known to Eastern
      old age, that purpose was afoot; this was to be no early-morning canter,
      merely out and home again; there was no time, now, for the customary
      tricks of corner-cutting and rest-snatching under eaves; she tucked her
      head down and jogged forward in the dust, more like a dog than ever. It
      was a dog's silent, striving determination to be there when the finish
      came&mdash;a dog's disregard of all object or objective but his master's&mdash;but
      a long-thrown stride, and a crafty, beady eye that promised more
      usefulness than a dog's when called on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first word spoken was when Rosemary drew rein a little more than
      half-way along the palace wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tired yet, Joanna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-uh!&rdquo; the woman answered, shaking her head violently and pointing at
      the sun that mounted every minute higher. The argument was obvious; in
      less than twenty minutes the whole horizon would be shimmering again like
      shaken plates of brass; wherever the other end might be, a rest would be
      better there than here! Her mistress nodded, and rode on again, faster
      yet; she had learned long ago that Joanna could show a dusty pair of heels
      to almost anything that ran, and she had never yet known distance tire
      her; it had been the thought of distance and speed combined that made her
      pause and ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not stop again until they had cantered up through the awakening
      bazaar, where unclean-looking merchants and their underlings rinsed out
      their teeth noisily above the gutters, and the pariah dogs had started
      nosing in among the muck for things unthinkable to eat. The sun had
      shortened up the shadows and begun to beat down through the gaps; the
      advance-guard of the shrivelling hot wind had raised foul dust eddies, and
      the city was ahum when she halted at last beside the big brick arch of the
      caravansary, where Mahommed Gunga's boots and spurs had caught her eye
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Joanna!&rdquo; She leaned back from the saddle and spoke low, but with a
      certain thrill. &ldquo;Go in there, find me Mahommed Gunga-sahib's man, and
      bring him out here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he will not come?&rdquo; The old woman seemed half-afraid to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in, and don't come out without him&mdash;unless you want to see me go
      in by myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman looked at her piercingly with eyes that gleamed from amid a
      bunch of wrinkles, then motioned with a skinny arm in the direction of an
      awning where shade was to be had from the dangerous early sun-rays. She
      made no move to enter through the arch until her mistress had taken
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later she emerged with Ali Partab, who looked sleepy, but
      still more ashamed of his unmilitary dishabille. Rosemary McClean glanced
      left and right&mdash;forgot about the awning and the custom which decrees
      aloofness&mdash;ignored the old woman's waving arm and Ali Partab's frown,
      and rode toward him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mahommed Gunga-sahib leave you here with any orders relative to me?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before he went away, he spoke to me of safety, and told me he would leave
      a link between me and men whom I may trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput bowed again. Neither of them saw an elbow laid on the
      window-ledge of a room above the arch; it disappeared, and very gingerly a
      bared black head replaced it. Then the head too disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes sparkled as the reassurance came that at least one good
      fighting man was waiting to do nothing but assist her. For the moment she
      threw caution to the winds and remembered nothing but her plight and her
      father's stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father will not come away, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab's eyes betrayed no trace of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;I thought&mdash;Are you all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone, Miss-sahib, but your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thought&mdash;perhaps that&rdquo;&mdash;she checked herself, then rushed
      the words out as though ashamed of them&mdash;&ldquo;that, if you had men to
      help you, you might carry him away against his will! Where are these
      others who are to be trusted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab grinned and then drew himself up with a movement of polite
      dissent. It was not for him to question the suggestions of a Miss-sahib;
      he conveyed that much with an inimitable air. But it was his business to
      keep strictly to the letter of his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss-sahib, I cannot do that. So said Mahommed Gunga: 'When the hag
      brings word, then take three horses and bear the Miss-sahib and her father
      to my cousin Alwa's place.' I stand ready to obey, but the padre-sahib
      comes not against his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whose place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alwa's, Miss-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo; She seemed bewildered. &ldquo;I had hoped to be escorted to
      some British residency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be for Alwa, should he see fit. He has men and horses, and a
      fort that is impregnable. The Miss-sahib would be safe there under all
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, supposing I declined to accept that invitation? Supposing
      I preferred not to be carried off to a&mdash;er&mdash;a Mohammedan
      gentleman's fort. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could but wait here, Miss-sahib, until the hour came when you changed
      your mind, or until Mahommed Gunga by letter or by word of mouth relieved
      me of my trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then you will wait here until I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, Miss-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head again peered through the window up above them, but disappeared
      below the ledge furtively, and none of the three were aware of it. For
      that matter, the old woman was gazing intently at Ali Partab and listening
      eagerly; he stood almost underneath the arch, and Miss McClean was staring
      at him frowning with the effort to translate her thoughts into a language
      that is very far from easy. They would none of them have seen the roof
      descending on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and won't you under any circumstances take us, say, to the
      Resident at Abu instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not, Miss-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a truth I know not. I never yet knew Mahommed Gunga to give an order
      without good reason for it; but beyond that he chose me, because he said
      the task might prove difficult and he trusted me, I know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no idea of the reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss-sahib, I am a soldier. To me an order is an order to be carried out;
      suspicions, fears are nothing unless they stand in the way of
      accomplishment. I await your word. I am ready. The horses are here&mdash;good
      horses&mdash;lean and hard. The order is that you must ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;er&mdash;Ali what?&mdash;thank you, Ali Partab.&rdquo; The
      disappointment in her voice was scarcely more noticeable than the
      despondency her drooping figure showed. The little shoulders that had sat
      so square and gallantly seemed to have lost their strength, and there was
      none of the determined ring left in the words she hesitated for. &ldquo;I&mdash;hope
      you will understand that I am grateful&mdash;but&mdash;I cannot&mdash;er&mdash;see
      my way just yet to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your good time, Miss-sahib. I was ordered to have patience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I will have more confidence, knowing that you are always close
      at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput bowed. She reined back. He saluted, and she bowed again; then,
      with a glance to make sure that Joanna followed, she started back at
      little more than a walking pace&mdash;a dejected wraith of a girl on a
      dejected-looking pony, too overcome by the upsetting of her rebellious
      scheme to care or even think whether Joanna dropped out of sight or not.
      Ali Partab watched her down the street with a face that betrayed no
      emotion and no suspicion of what his thoughts might be. When she was out
      of sight he went back under the arch to attend to his three horses; and
      the moment that he did so a fat but very furtive Hindoo took his place&mdash;glanced
      down the street once in the direction that Rosemary had taken&mdash;and
      then darted up-street as fast as his shaking paunch would let him. He had
      been gone at the least ten minutes, when Joanna, also furtive, also in a
      hurry, dodged here and there among the commencing surge of traffic and
      approached the arch again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be useless to try to read her mind, or to translate the glitter
      of her beady eyes into thoughts intelligible to any but an Oriental. It
      was quite clear, though, that she wished not to be noticed, that she
      feared the occupants of the caravansary, and that she had returned for
      word with Ali Partab. He, least of all, would have doubted her intention
      of demanding the two gold mohurs, for it was she who had brought the word
      that Miss McClean wanted him. But what relation that intention had to her
      loyalty or treachery, or whether she were capable of either&mdash;capable
      of anything except greed, and obedience for the sake of pay&mdash;were
      problems no man living could have guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked the lounging sweeper by the arch whether Ali Partab had ridden
      out as yet. He jeered back outrageous improprieties, suggestive of
      impossible ambition on the hag's part. She called him &ldquo;sahib,&rdquo; dubbed him
      &ldquo;father of a dozen stalwart sons,&rdquo; returned a few of his immodest
      compliments with a flattering laugh, and learned that Ali Partab was still
      busy in the caravansary. Then she proceeded to make herself very
      inconspicuous beside a two-wheeled wagon, up-ended in the gutter opposite
      the arch, and waited with eastern patience for the horseman to ride out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the fat Hindoo come back, in no particular hurry now, and seat
      himself not far from her. Later she saw eight horsemen ride down the
      street, pass the arch, wheel, and halt. She noticed that they were not
      Maharajah Howrah's men but a portion of his brother Jaimihr's body-guard,
      then took no further notice of them. If they chose to wait there, it was
      no affair of hers, and to appear inquisitive would be to invite a
      lance-butt, very shrewdly thrust where it would hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an hour at least before Ali Partab rode out through the arch,
      looking down anxiously at his horse's off-hind that had been showing
      symptoms of &ldquo;brushing&rdquo; lately. Joanna rose instantly to cross the street
      and intercept him; and she recoiled in the nick of time to save herself
      from being ridden down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from the fat Hindoo the eight horsemen spurred, and swooped
      up-street with the speed and certainty of sparrow-hawks and the noise of
      devastation. They rode down Ali Partab&mdash;unhorsed him&mdash;bound him&mdash;threw
      him on his horse again&mdash;and galloped off before any but the Hindoo
      had time to realize that he was their objective. He was gone&mdash;snatched
      like a chicken from the coop. Noise and dust were all the trace or
      explanation that he left. The mazy streets swallowed him; the Hindoo
      waddled over to the arch and disappeared without a smile on his face to
      show even interest. The interrupted trading and bartering went on again,
      and no one commented or made a move to follow but Joanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched the fat Hindoo, and made sure that she would recognize him
      anywhere again. Then, by a trail that no one would have guessed at and few
      could have followed, she made her way to Jaimihr's palace&mdash;three
      miles away from Howrah's&mdash;where a dozen sulky-looking sepoys lolled,
      dismounted, by the wooden gate. There was neither sight nor sound of
      mounted men, and the gate was shut; but in the middle of the roadway there
      was smoking dung, and there was a suspicion of overacting about the
      indifference of the guardians of the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no overacting, though, in what Joanna did. Nobody would have
      dreamed that she was playing any kind of part, or interested in anything
      at all except the coppers that she begged for. She squatted in the
      roadway, ink-black and clear-cut in the now blazing sunlight, alternately
      flattering them and pretending to a knowledge of unguessed-at witchcraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there still at midday when they changed the guard. She was there
      when night fell, still squatting in the roadway, still exchanging repartee
      and hints at the supernatural with armed men who shuddered now and then
      between their bursts of mockery. The sore, suffering dogs that sniff
      through the night for worse eyesores than themselves whimpered and watched
      her. The guard changed and the moon paled, but she stayed on; and whatever
      her purpose, or whatever information she obtained in fragments amid the
      raillery, she did not return to the mission house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Rosemary McClean returned and dismounted by the door that
      she realized Joanna had not kept pace. Even then she thought little of it;
      the old woman often lingered on the homeward way when the chance of her
      being needed was remote. Two or three hours passed before the suspicion
      rose that anything might have happened to Joanna, and even then she might
      not have been remembered had not Duncan McClean asked for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind,&rdquo; he said, calling Rosemary into the long, low
      living-room. It was darkened to exclude the hot wind and the glare, and he
      looked like a ghost as he rose to meet her. &ldquo;I have decided that my duty
      is to get away from this place for your sake and for the sake of the cause
      I have at heart. We are doing no good here. I can do most by going to the
      Resident, or even to somebody higher up than he, and laying my case before
      him personally. Send for Joanna, and tell her to go and bring Mahommed
      Gunga's man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that they missed Joanna and began to search for her. But no
      Joanna came. It was then that Rosemary McClean rehearsed with her father
      her former conversation with Mahommed Gunga and part, at least, of her
      recent one with Ali Partab, and the missionary started off himself to find
      the horseman whom Mahommed Gunga had so thoughtfully left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he very naturally found no Ali Partab. What he did discover was that
      he was followed&mdash;that a guard, unarmed but obvious, was placed around
      the mission house&mdash;that his servants deserted one by one&mdash;that
      no more children came to the mission school.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to take chances and ride off with his daughter in the night.
      But the ponies went mysteriously lame, and nobody would lend or sell him
      horses on any terms at all. He did his best to get a letter through to
      anywhere where there were British, but nobody would take it. And then
      Jaimihr came, swaggering with his escort, to offer him and his daughter
      the hospitality of his palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declined that offer a little testily, for the insolence behind the
      offer was less than half concealed. Jaimihr sneered as he rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a month or two of undisturbed enjoyment will induce the
      padre-sahib to change his mind about my invitation!&rdquo; he said nastily. And
      he made no secret then, as he ordered them about before he went, that the
      men who lounged and watched at every vantage-point were his.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    They looked into my eyes and laughed,&mdash;
            But, what when I was gone?
    Have strong men made me one of them?
            Or do I ride alone?
</pre>
    <p>
      ON the morning after Mahommed Gunga's daring experiment with Cunningham's
      nervous system he was anxious to say the least of it; and that is only
      another way of saying that he was irritable. He watched the Englishman at
      breakfast, on the dak-bungalow veranda, with a sideways restless glance
      that gave the lie a dozen times over to his assumed air of irascible
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see now what we will see,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;These who
      know such a lot imagine that the test is made. They forget that there be
      many brave men of whom but a few are fit to lead. Now&mdash;now&mdash;we
      will see!&rdquo; And he kept on repeating that assurance to himself, with the
      air of a man who would like to be assured, but is not, while he
      ostentatiously found fault with every single thing on which his eyes lit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think that the Risaldar-sahib were afraid of consequences!&rdquo;
       whispered the youngest of his followers, stung to the quick by a quite
      unmerited rebuke. &ldquo;Does he fear that Chota-Cunnigan will beat him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      White men have been known&mdash;often&mdash;to do stupider things than
      that, and particularly young white men who have not yet learned to gauge
      proportions accurately; so there was nothing really ridiculous in the
      suggestion. A young white man who has had his temper worked up to the
      boiling-point, his nerves deliberately racked, and then has been subjected
      to the visit of a driven tiger, may be confidently expected to exhibit all
      the faults of which his character is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the situation even more ticklish, Cunningham's servant, in his
      zeal for his master's comfort, had forgotten to sham sickness, and instead
      of limping was in abominably active evidence. He was even doing more than
      was expected of him. Ralph Cunningham had said nothing to him&mdash;had
      not needed to; every single thing that a pampered sahib could imagine that
      he needed was done for him in the proper order, without noise or
      awkwardness, and the Risaldar cursed as he watched the clockwork-perfect
      service. He had hoped for a lapse that might call forth some pointer,
      either by way of irritation or amusement, as to how young Cunningham was
      taking things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not a thing went wrong and not a sign of any sort gave Cunningham. The
      youngster did not smile either to himself darkly or at his servant. He lit
      his after-breakfast cigar and smoked it peacefully, as though he had spent
      an absolutely normal night, without even a dream to worry him, and if he
      eyed Mahommed Gunga at all, he did it so naturally, and with so little
      interest, that no deductions could be drawn from it. He was neither more
      nor less than a sahib at his ease&mdash;which was disconcerting, very, to
      the Oriental mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked the cigar to a finish, without a word or sign that he wished to
      give audience. Then his eyes lit for the first time on the tiger-skin that
      was pegged out tight, raw side upward, for the sun to sterilize; he threw
      the butt of his cigar away and strolled out to examine the skin without a
      sign to Mahommed Gunga, counted the claws one by one to make sure that no
      superstitious native had purloined any of them, and returned to his chair
      on the veranda without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he vindictive, then?&rdquo; wondered Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Is he a mean man? Will
      he bear malice and get even with me later on? If so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present my compliments to Mahommed Gunga-sahib, and ask him to be good
      enough to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Risaldar heard the order, and was on his way to the veranda before the
      servant started to convey the message. He took no chances on a reprimand
      about his shoes, for he swaggered up in riding-boots, which no soldier can
      be asked to take off before he treads on a private floor; and he saluted
      as a soldier, all dignity. It was the only way by which he could be sure
      to keep the muscles of his face from telling tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huzoor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Mahommed Gunga. Take a seat, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A camp-chair creaked under the descending Rajput's weight, and creaked
      again as he remembered to settle himself less stiffly&mdash;less guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, I'm going to ask you chaps to do me a favor. You don't mind
      obliging me now and then, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youngster leaned forward confidentially, one elbow on his knee, and
      looked half-serious, as though what he had to ask were more important than
      the ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, there is nothing that we will not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then you won't mind my mentioning this, I'm sure. Next time you want
      to kennel a tiger in my bedroom, d'you mind giving me notice in advance?
      It's not the stink I mind, nor being waked up; it's the deuced awful risk
      of hurting somebody. Besides&mdash;look how I spoilt that tiger's mask!
      The skins I've always admired at home had been shot where it didn't show
      so badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not even the symptom of a smile on Cunningham's face. He looked
      straight into Mahommed Gunga's eyes, and spoke as one man talking calm
      common sense to another. He raised his hand as the Rajput began to stammer
      an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don't apologize. If you'll forgive me for shooting your pet tiger,
      I'll overlook the rest of it. If I'd known that you kept him in there o'
      nights, I'd have chosen another room, that's all&mdash;some room where I
      couldn't smell him, and where I shouldn't run the risk of killing an
      inoffensive man. Why, I might have shot you! Think how sorry I'd have
      been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Risaldar did not quite know what to say; so, wiser than most, he said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and one other matter. I don't speak much of the language yet, so,
      would you mind translating to my servant that the next time he goes sick
      without giving me notice, and without putting oil in my lamp, I'll have
      him fed to the tiger before he's brought into my room? Just tell him that
      quietly, will you? Say it slowly so that it sinks in. Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Straight-faced as Cunningham himself, the Risaldar tongue-lashed the
      servant with harsh, tooth-rasping words that brought him up to attention.
      Whether he interpreted or not the exact meaning of what Cunningham had
      said, he at least produced the desired effect; the servant mumbled
      apologetic nothings and slunk off the veranda backward&mdash;to go away
      and hold his sides with laughter at the back of the dak-bungalow. There
      Mahommed Gunga found him afterward and administered a thrashing&mdash;not,
      as he was careful to explain, for disobedience, but for having dared to be
      amused at the Risaldar's discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was still one point that weighed heavily on Mahommed Gunga's
      mind as the servant shuffled off and left him alone face to face with
      Cunningham. There is as a very general rule not more than one man-eating
      tiger in a neighborhood, and not even the greenest specimen of subaltern
      new brought from home would be likely to mistake one for the other kind.
      The man-eater was dead, and there was an engagement to shoot one that very
      morning. He hesitated&mdash;said nothing for the moment&mdash;and wondered
      whether his best course would be to go ahead and pretend to beat out the
      jungle and tell some lie or other about the tiger having got away. But
      Ralph Cunningham, with serious gray eyes fixed full on his, saved him the
      trouble of deciding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's all one to you, Mahommed Gunga,&rdquo; he said, the corner of his mouth
      just flickering, &ldquo;we'll move on from here at once. This is a beastly old
      bungalow to sleep in, and shooting tigers don't seem so terribly exciting
      to me. Besides, the climate here must be rotten for the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;if the choice rests with me, I wish it. It might&mdash;ah&mdash;save
      the villagers a lot of hard work beating through the jungle, mightn't it&mdash;besides,
      there'll be other tigers on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Innumerable tigers, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Will you order a start then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Risaldar departed round the corner of the bungalow, and a minute or
      two later Cunningham's ears caught the sound of a riding-switch, lustily
      applied, and of muffled groans. He suspected readily enough what was going
      on, particularly since his servant was not in evidence, but he dared not
      laugh on the veranda. He went inside, and made believe to be busy with his
      bag before he relaxed the muscles of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I wonder whether I handled that situation rightly?&rdquo; he asked himself
      between chuckles. &ldquo;One thing I know&mdash;if that old ruffian plays
      another trick on me&mdash;one more of any kind&mdash;Ill show my teeth.
      There's a thing known as the limit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not have wondered, though, if he could have overheard Mahommed
      Gunga less than an hour later. The Risaldar had stayed behind to make sure
      nothing had been forgotten, and one of his men remained with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be sahibs and then sahibs,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Two kinds are the
      worst&mdash;those who strike readily in anger and use bad language when
      annoyed, and those whose lips are thin and who save their vengeance to be
      wreaked later on. They are worse, either of them, than the sahib who is
      usually drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cunnigan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is altogether otherwise. As his father was, and as a few other sahibs I
      have met, he understands what is not spoken&mdash;concedes dignity to him
      who is caught napping, as one who having disarmed his adversary, allows
      him to recover his weapon&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proves himself a man worth following! I myself will slit the throat of
      any man I catch disparaging the name of Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur! By the
      blood of God&mdash;by my medals, my own honor, and the good name of
      Pukka-Cunnigan, his father, I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rung Ho!&rdquo; grinned the six-foot son of war who, rode beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode on at a walk past the tombstone that&mdash;at Mahommed Gunga's
      orders&mdash;the villagers had decked with sickly scented forest flowers,
      and as they passed they both saluted it in silence. The fakir of the night
      before, sitting not very far away from it, mimicked them. He sprang on the
      stone as soon as they were out of sight, scattering the flowers all about
      him, and calling down the vengeance of a hundred gods on the heads of
      Christian and Mohammedan alike.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    From lone hunt came the yearling cub
            And brought a grown kill back;
    With fangs aglut &ldquo;'Tis nothing but
            Presumption!&rdquo; growled the pack.
</pre>
    <p>
      RALPH CUNNINGHAM reached Peshawur at last with no less than nine tigers to
      his gun, and that in itself would have been sufficient to damn him in the
      eyes of more than half of the men who held commands there. Jealousy in
      those days of slow promotion and intrenched influence had eaten into the
      very understanding of men whose only excuse for rule over a conquered
      people ought to have been understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not considered decent for a boy of twenty-one to do much more than
      dare to be alive. For any man at all to offer advice or information to his
      senior was rank presumption. Criticism was high treason. Sport, such as
      tiger-shooting, was for those whose age and apoplectic temper rendered
      them least fitted for it. Conservatism reigned: &ldquo;High Toryism, sir, old
      port, and proud Prerogative!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga grinned into his beard at the reception that awaited the
      youngster whom he had trained for months now in the belief that India had
      nothing much to do except reverence him. He laughed aloud, when he could
      get away to do it, at the flush of indignation on his protege's face.
      Tall, lean-limbed, full of health and spirits, he had paid his duty call
      on a General of Division; with the boyish enthusiasm that says so plainly,
      &ldquo;Laugh with me, for the world is mine!&rdquo; he had boasted his good luck on
      the road, only to be snubbed thoroughly and told that tiger-shooting was
      not what he came for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the snub like a man and made no complaint to anybody; he did not
      even mention it to the other subalterns, who, most of them, made no secret
      of their dissatisfaction and its hundred causes. He listened, and it was
      not very long before it dawned on him that, had not Mahommed Gunga gone
      with him to pay a call as well, the General Division would not have so
      much as interviewed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga soon became the bane of his existence. The veteran seemed
      in no hurry to go back to his estate that must have been in serious need
      of management by this time, but would ride off on mysterious errands and
      return with a dozen or more black-bearded horsemen each time. He would
      introduce them to Cunningham in public whenever possible under the eyes of
      outraged seniors who would swear and, fume and ride away disgust at the
      reverence paid to &ldquo;a mere boy, sir&mdash;a bally, ignorant young
      jackanapes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Cunningham been other than a born soldier with his soldier senses all
      on edge and sleepless, he would have fallen foul of disgrace within a
      month. He was unattached as yet, and that fact gave opportunity to the men
      who looked for it to try to &ldquo;take the conceit out of the cub, by gad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They &ldquo;&mdash;everybody spoke of them as &ldquo;they&rdquo;&mdash;conceived the
      brilliant idea of confronting the youngster with conditions which he
      lacked experience to cope with. They set him to deal with circumstances
      which had long ago proved too difficult for themselves, and awaited
      confidently the outcome&mdash;the crass mistake, or oversight, or mere
      misfortune that, with the aid of a possible court martial, would reduce
      him to a proper state of humbleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peshawur, the greatest garrison in northern India, was there on
      sufferance, apparently. For lack of energetic men in authority to deal
      with them, the border robbers plundered while the troops remained cooped
      up within the unhealthiest station on the list. The government itself,
      with several thousand troops to back it up, was paying blackmail to the
      border thieves! There was not a government bungalow in all Peshawur that
      did not have its &ldquo;watchman,&rdquo; hired from over the border, well paid to
      sleep on the veranda lest his friends should come and take tribute in an
      even more unseemly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger men, whose sense of fitness had not yet been rotted by climate
      and system and prerogative, swore at the condition; there were one or two
      men higher up, destined to make history, whose voices, raised in emphatic
      protest, were drowned in the drone of &ldquo;Peace! Peace is the thing to work
      for. Compromise, consideration, courtesy, these three are the keys of
      rule.&rdquo; They failed to realize that cowardice was their real keynote, and
      that the threefold method that they vaunted was quite useless without a
      stiffening of courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      So brave men, who had more courtesy in each of their fingers than most of
      the seniors had all put together, had to bow to a scandalous condition
      that made England's rule a laughing-stock within a stone's throw of the
      city limits. And they had to submit to the indecency of seeing a new,
      inexperienced arrival picked for the task of commanding a body of
      irregulars, for no other reason than because it was considered wise to
      make an exhibition of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham became half policeman, half soldier, in charge of a small
      special force of mounted men engaged for the purpose of patrol. He had
      nothing to do with the selection of them; that business was attended to
      perfunctorily by a man very high up in departmental service, who
      considered Cunningham a nuisance. He was a gentleman who did not know
      Mahommed Gunga; another thing he did not know was the comfortable feel of
      work well done; so he was more than pleased when Mahommed Gunga dropped in
      from nowhere in particular&mdash;paid him scandalously untrue compliments
      without a blush or a smile and offered to produce the required number of
      men at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only fifty were required. Mahommed Gunga brought three hundred to select
      from, and, when asked to do so in order to save time and trouble, picked
      out the fifty best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are your men!&rdquo; said the Personage off-handedly, when they had been
      sworn in in a group. &ldquo;Be good enough to remember, Mr. Cunningham, that you
      are now responsible for their behavior, and for the proper night
      patrolling of the city limits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a tall order, and in spite of all of youth's enthusiasm was
      enough to make any young fellow nervous. But Mahommed Gunga met him in the
      street, saluted him with almost sacrilegious ceremony, and drew him to one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have courage, now, bahadur! I ride away to visit my estates (he spoke of
      them always in the plural, as though he owned a county or two). You have
      under you the best eyes and the keenest blades along the border for I
      attended to it! Be ruthless! Use them, work them&mdash;sweat them to
      death! Keep away from messes and parades; seek no praise, for you will get
      none in any case! Work! Work for what is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though the fate of a continent were hanging in the balance,&rdquo;
       laughed Cunningham, shaking hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak truth!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga, riding off and leaving the youngster
      wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was nothing much the matter with the men on either side, taken
      in the main, who hated one another on that far-pushed frontier. Even the
      insufferable incompetents who held the rotting reins of control were such
      because circumstance had blinded them. There was not a man among the
      highly placed ones even who would have deliberately placed his own
      importance or his own opinion in the scale against India's welfare. There
      was not a border thief but was ready to respect what he could recognize as
      strong-armed justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The root of the trouble lay in centralization of authority, and rigid
      adherence to the rule of seniority. Combined, these two processes had
      served to bring about a state of things that is nearly unbelievable when
      viewed in the light of modern love for efficiency. Young men, with the
      fire of ambition burning in them and a proper scorn for mere superficial
      ceremony, had to sweat their tempers and bow down beneath the yoke of
      senile pompousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong, savage, powder-weaned Hill-tribesmen&mdash;inheritors of egoistic
      independence and a love of loot&mdash;laughed loud and long and openly at
      System that prevented officers from taking arms against them until
      authority could come by delegate from somebody who slept. By that time
      they would be across the border, quarrelling among themselves about
      division of the plunder!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had respect in plenty for the youth and virile middle age that dealt
      with them on the rare occasions when a timely blow was loosed. Then they
      had proof that from that strange, mad country overseas there came men who
      could lead men&mdash;men who could strike, and who knew enough to hold
      their hands when the sudden blow had told&mdash;just men, who could keep
      their plighted word. No border thief pretended that the British could not
      rule him; to a man, they laughed because the possible was not imposed. And
      to the last bold, ruffianly iconoclast they stole when, where, and what
      they dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things altered strangely soon after Ralph Cunningham, with the diffidence
      of youth but the blood of a line of soldiers leaping in him, took charge
      of his tiny force of nondescripts. They were neither soldiers nor police.
      Nominally, he was everybody's dog, and so were they; actually he found
      himself at the head of a tiny department of his own, because it was
      nobody's affair to give him orders. They had deliberately turned him loose
      &ldquo;to hang himself,&rdquo; and their hope that he might get his head into a noose
      of trouble as soon as possible&mdash;the very liberty they gave him, on
      purpose for his quick damnation&mdash;was the means of making reputation
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody advised him; so with singularly British phlegm and not more than
      ordinary common sense he devised a method of his own for scotching
      night-prowlers. He stationed his men at well-considered vantage-points,
      and trusted them. With a party of ten, he patrolled the city ceaselessly
      himself and whipped every &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; he caught sleeping. One by one, the
      blackmailing brigade began to see the discomfort of a job that called for
      real wakefulness, and deserted over the Hills to urge the resumption of
      raids in force. One by one, the night-prowling fraternity were shot as
      they sneaked past sentries. One by one, the tale of robberies diminished.
      It was merely a question of one man, and he awake, having power to act
      without first submitting a request to somebody in triplicate on blue-form
      B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came, after a month or two, when even natives dared to leave
      their houses after dark. The time came very soon, indeed, when the nearest
      tribes began to hold war councils and inveigh against the falling off of
      the supply of plunder. Cunningham was complimented openly. He was even
      praised by one of &ldquo;Them.&rdquo; So it was perfectly natural, and quite in
      keeping with tradition, that he should shortly be relieved, and that a
      senior to him should be placed in charge of his little force, with orders
      to &ldquo;organize&rdquo; it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organization process lasted about twelve hours; at the end of that
      time every single man had deserted, horse and arms! Two nights later, the
      prowling and plundering was once more in full swing, and Cunningham was
      blamed for it; it was obvious to any man of curry-and-port-wine
      proclivities that his method, or lack of it, had completely undermined his
      men's loyalty!
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole committee of gray-headed gentlemen took trouble to point out to
      him his utter failure; but a brigadier, who was not a member of that
      committee, and who was considered something of an upstart, asked that he
      might be appointed to a troop of irregular cavalry that had recently been
      raised. With glee&mdash;with a sigh of relief so heartfelt and unanimous
      that it could be heard across the street&mdash;the committee leaped at the
      suggestion. The proper person was induced without difficulty to put his
      signature to the required paper, and Cunningham found himself transferred
      to irregular oblivion. Incidentally he found himself commanding few less
      than a hundred men, so many of whose first names were Mahommed or Mohammed
      that the muster-roll looked like a list of Allah's prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham was more than a little bit astonished, on the day he joined, in
      camp, a long way from Peshawur, to find his friend Mahommed Gunga, seated
      in a bell tent with the Brigadier. He caught sight of the long black
      military boot and silver spur, and half-recognized the up-and-down
      movement of the crossed leg long before he reached the tent. It was like
      father and son meeting, almost, as the Rajput rose to greet him and waited
      respectfully until he had paid his compliments to his new commander.
      Cunningham felt throat-bound, and could scarcely more than stammer his
      introduction of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who you are and all about you,&rdquo; said the Brigadier. &ldquo;Used to know
      your father well. I applied to have you in my command partly for your
      father's sake, but principally because Risaldar Mahommed Gunga spake so
      highly of you. He tells me he has had an eye on you from the start, and
      that you shape well. Remember, this is irregular cavalry, and in many
      respects quite unlike regulars. You'll need tact and a firm hand combined,
      and you mustn't ever forget that the men whom you will lead are
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham reported to his Colonel, only to discover that he, too, knew
      all about him. The Colonel was less inclined to be restricted as to topic,
      and less mindful of discretion than the Brigadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear they couldn't stand you in Peshawur. That's hopeful! If you'd come
      with a recommendation from that quarter, I'd have packed you off back
      again. I never in my life would have believed that a dozen men could all
      shut their eyes so tightly to the signs&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signs, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the signs! Come and look your troop over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham found that the troop, too, had heard about his coming. He did
      not look them over. When he reached the lines, they came out in a swarm&mdash;passed
      him one by one, eyed him, as traders eye a horse&mdash;and then saluted
      him a second time, with the greeting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! You're in disgrace!&rdquo; said his Colonel, noticing the color rising to
      the youngster's cheeks.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Sons of the sons of war we be,
    Sabred and horsed, and whole and free;
    One is the caste, and one degree,&mdash;
            One law,&mdash;one code decreed us.
    Who heads wolves in the dawning day?
    Who leaps in when the bull's at bay?
    He who dare is he who may!
            Now, rede ye who shall lead us!
</pre>
    <p>
      THE check that Ralph Cunningham's management of his police had caused, and
      the subsequent resumption of night looting, served to whet the appetites
      of the hungry crowd beyond the border. Those closest to Peshawur, who had
      always done the looting, were not the ultimate consignees by any means;
      there were other tribes who bought from them&mdash;others yet to whom they
      paid tribute in the shape of stolen rifles. Cunningham's administration
      had upset the whole modus vivendi of the lower Himalayas!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it all began again the moment he was superseded, there had been,
      none the less, a three-month interregnum, and that had to be compensated
      for. The tribes at the rear were clamorous and would not listen to
      argument or explanation; they had collected in hundreds, led by the
      notorious Khumel Khan, preparatory to raiding in real earnest and with
      sufficient force to carry all before them at the first surprise attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were disappointed when the pilfering resumed, for a tribal Hillman
      would generally rather fight than eat, and would always prefer his dinner
      from a dead enemy's cooking-pot. They sat about for a long time,
      considering whether there were not excuse enough for war in any case and
      listening to the intricately detailed information brought by the deserting
      watchmen. And as they discussed things, but before they had time to decide
      on any plan, the Brigadier commanding the Irregulars got wind of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man who did not worry about the feelings of senile heads of
      red-tape-bound departments; nor was he particularly hidebound by respect
      for the laws of evidence. When he knew a thing, he knew it; then he either
      acted or did not act, as the circumstances might dictate. And when the
      deed was done or left undone, and was quite beyond the reach of criticism,
      he would send in a verbose, voluminous report, written out in several
      colored inks, on all the special forms he could get hold of. The heads of
      departments would be too busy for the next twelvemonth trying to get the
      form of the report straightened out to be able to give any attention to
      the details of it; and then it would be too late. But he was a brigadier,
      and what he could do with impunity and quiet amusement would have brought
      down the whole Anglo-Indian Government in awful wrath on the head of a
      subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard of the tribesmen under Khumel Khan one evening. At dawn his tents
      stood empty and the horse-lines were long bands of brown on the green
      grass. The pegs were up; only the burying beetles labored where the
      stamping chargers had neighed overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunger-making wind that sweeps down, snow-sweetened, from the
      Himalayas bore with it intermittent thunder from four thousand hoofs as,
      split in three and swooping from three different directions, the squadrons
      viewed, gave tongue, and launched themselves, roaring, at the
      half-awakened plotters of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a battle, of a kind, in a bowlder-lined valley where the early
      morning sun had not yet reached to lift the chill. Long lances&mdash;devils'
      antennae&mdash;searched out the crevices where rock-bred mountain-men
      sought cover; too suddenly for clumsy-fingered Hillmen to reload, the
      reformed troops charged wedgewise into rallying detachments. In an hour,
      or less, there were prisoners being herded like cattle in the valley
      bottom, and a sting had been drawn from the border wasp that would not
      grow again for a year or two to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Khumel Khan was missing. Khumel Khan, the tulwar man&mdash;he whose
      boast it was that he could hew through two men's necks at one whistling
      sweep of his notched, curved cimeter&mdash;had broken through with a dozen
      at his back. He had burst through the half-troop guarding the upper end of
      the defile, had left them red and reeling to count their dead, and the
      overfolding hill-spurs swallowed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cunningham! Take your troop, please, and find their chief! Hunt him
      out, ride him down, and get him! Don't come back until you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The real thing! The real red thing within a year! A lone command&mdash;and
      that is the only thing a subaltern of spunk may pray for!&mdash;eighty-and-eight
      hawk-eyed troopers asking only for the opportunity to show their worth&mdash;lean,
      hungry hills to hunt in, no commissariat, fair law to the quarry, and a
      fight&mdash;as sure as God made mountains, a fight at the other end! There
      are men here and there who think that the day when they pass down a
      crowded aisle with Her is the great one, other great days are all as
      gas-jets to the sun. And there are others. There are men, like Cunningham,
      who have heard the drumming of the hoofs behind them as they led their
      first un-apron-stringed unit out into the unknown. The one kind of man has
      tasted honey, but the other knows what fed, and feeds, the roaring
      sportsmen in Valhalla.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were crisscross trails, where low-hung clouds swept curtainwise to
      make the compass seem like a lie-begotten trick. There were gorges, hewn
      when the Titans needed dirt to build the awful Himalayas&mdash;shadow-darkened&mdash;sheer
      as the edge of Nemesis. Long-reaching, pile on pile, the over-lapping
      spurs leaned over them. The wind blew through them amid silence that
      swallowed and made nothing of the din which rides with armed men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, with eyes that were made for hunting, on horses that seemed part of
      them, they tracked and trailed&mdash;and viewed at last. Their shout gave
      Khumel Khan his notice that the price of a hundred murders was overdue,
      and he chose to make payment where a V-shaped cliff enclosed a small, flat
      plateau and not more than a dozen could ride at him at a time. His
      companions scattered much as a charge of shrapnel shrieks through the
      rocks, but Khumel Khan knew well enough that he was the quarry&mdash;his
      was the head that by no conceivable chance would be allowed to plan fresh
      villainies. He might have run yet a little way, but he saw the
      uselessness, and stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troop, lined out knee to knee, could come within a hundred paces of
      him without breaking; it formed a base, then, to a triangle from which the
      man at bay could no more escape than a fire-ringed scorpion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call on him to surrender!&rdquo; ordered Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chevroned black-beard half a horse-length behind him translated the
      demand into stately Pashtu, and for answer the hill chieftain mounted his
      stolen horse and shook his tulwar. He had pistols at his belt, but he did
      not draw them; across his shoulder swung a five-foot-long jezail, but he
      loosed it and flung it to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any here dare take me single-handed?&rdquo; he demanded with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the eight-and-eighty, there were eighty-eight who dared; but there was
      an eighty-ninth, a lad of not yet twenty-two, whom Indian chivalry desired
      to honor. The troop had heard but the troop had not yet seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride in and take him!&rdquo; ordered Cunningham and there was a thoroughly well
      acted make-believe of fear, while every eye watched &ldquo;Cunnigan-bahadur,&rdquo;
       and the horses, spurred and reined at once, pranced at their bits for just
      so long as a good man needs to make his mind up. And Cunningham rode in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode in as a Rajput rides, with a swoop and a swinging sabre and a
      silent, tight-lipped vow that he would prove himself. Green though he was
      yet, he knew that the troop had found for him&mdash;had rounded up for him&mdash;had
      made him his opportunity; so he took it, right under their eyes, straight
      in the teeth of the stoutest tulwar man of the lower Himalayas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, had pistols at his belt, but there was no shot fired. There was
      nothing but a spur-loosed rush and a shock&mdash;a spark-lit, swirling,
      slashing, stamping, snorting melee&mdash;a stallion and a mare up-ended&mdash;two
      strips of lightning steel that slit the wind&mdash;and a thud, as a
      lifeless border robber took the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence then&mdash;the grim, good silence of Mohammedan approval&mdash;while
      a native officer closed up a sword-cut with his fingers and tore ten-yard
      strips from his own turban to bind the youngster's head. They rode back
      without boast or noise and camped without advertisement. There was no
      demonstration made; only-a colonel said, &ldquo;I like things done that way,
      quickly, without fuss,&rdquo; and a brigadier remarked, &ldquo;Hrrrumph! 'Gratulate
      you, Mr. Cunningham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, when they camped again outside Peshawur, a reward of three thousand
      rupees that had been offered on the border outlaw's head was paid to
      Cunningham in person&mdash;a very appreciable sum to a subaltern, whose
      pay is barely sufficient for his mess bills. So, although no public
      comment was made on the matter, it was considered &ldquo;decent of him&rdquo; to
      contribute the whole amount to a pension fund for the dependents of the
      regiment's dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, that's your money,&rdquo; said his Colonel. &ldquo;You can keep every anna
      of it if you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I needn't be an officer unless I choose?&rdquo; suggested Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, youngster! I can't guess what your troop would do if you
      tried to desert it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was, of course, merely a diplomatic recognition of the fact that
      Cunningham had done his duty in making his men like him, and was not
      intended seriously. Nobody&mdash;not even the Brigadier&mdash;had any
      notion that the troop would very shortly have to dispense with its
      leader's services whether it wanted to or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it so happened that one troop at a time was requisitioned to be
      ornamental body-guard to such as were entitled to one in the frontier
      city; and the turn arrived when Cunningham was sent. None liked the duty.
      No soldier, and particularly no irregular, likes to consider himself a
      pipe-clayed ornament; but Cunningham would have &ldquo;gone sick&rdquo; had he had the
      least idea of what was in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bad enough to be obliged to act as body-guard to men who had
      jockeyed him away because they were jealous of him. The white scar that
      ran now like a chin-strap mark from the corner of his eye to the angle of
      his jaw would blaze red often at some deliberately thought-out, not
      fancied, insult from men who should have been too big to more than notice
      him. And that, again, was nothing to the climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga chose to polish up his silver spurs and ride in from his
      &ldquo;estates&rdquo; on a protracted visit to Peshawur, and with an escort that must
      have included half the zemindars on the countryside as well as his own
      small retinue. Glittering on his own account like a regiment of horse, and
      with all but a regiment clattering behind him, he chose the occasion to
      meet Cunningham when the youngster was fuming with impatience opposite the
      club veranda, waiting to escort a general.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the veranda sat a dozen men who had been at considerable pains to put
      and keep the officer of the escort in his place. If the jingle and glitter
      of the approaching cavalcade had not been sufficient to attract their
      notice, they could have stopped their cars and yet have been forced to
      hear the greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Salaam sahib! Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur, bohut salaam! Thy father's
      son! Sahib, I am much honored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white scar blazed, but Mahommed Gunga affected not to notice the
      discomfort of his victim. Many more than a hundred sabred gentlemen
      pressed round to &ldquo;do themselves the honor,&rdquo; as they expressed it, of
      paying Cunningham a compliment. They rode up like knights in armor in the
      lists, and saluted like heralds bringing tribute and allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, Chota-Cunnigan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bohut salaam, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Generals, the High-Court judges, and Commissioners on the club veranda
      sat unhonored, while a boy of twenty-two received obeisance from men whose
      respect a king might envy. No Rajput ever lived who was not sure that his
      salute was worth more than tribute; he can be polite on all occasions, and
      what he thinks mere politeness would be considered overacting in the West,
      but his respect and his salute he keeps for his equals or his betters&mdash;and
      they must be men indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coterie of high officials sat indignation-bound for ten palpitating
      minutes, until the General remembered that it was his escort that was
      waiting for him. He had ordered it an hour too soon, for the express sweet
      purpose of keeping Cunningham waiting in the sun, but it dawned now on his
      apoplectic consciousness that his engagement was most urgent. He descended
      in a pompous hurry, mounted and demanded why&mdash;by all the gods of
      India&mdash;the escort was not lined up to receive him. A minute later,
      after a loudly administered reprimand that was meant as much for the swarm
      of Rajputs as for the indignant Cunningham, he rode off with the escort
      clattering behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the club veranda, when the Rajputs with Mahommed Gunga had
      dispersed, the big wigs sat and talked the matter over very thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use blinking matters,&rdquo; said the senior man present, using a huge
      handkerchief to wave the flies away from the polished dome which rose
      between two side wisps of gray hair. &ldquo;They're going to lionize him while
      he's here, so we'd better move him on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got it! There's a letter in from Everton at Abu, saying he needs a
      man badly to go to Howrah and act resident there&mdash;says he hasn't
      heard from the missionaries and isn't satisfied&mdash;wants a man without
      too much authority to go there and keep an eye on things in general.
      Howrah's a hell of a place from all accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that 'ud be promotion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't be helped. No excuse for reducing him, so far as I've heard. The
      trouble is the cub has done too dashed well. We've got to promote him if
      we want to be rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked it over for an hour, and at the end of it decided Cunningham
      should go to Howrah, provided a brigadier could be induced without too
      much argument to see reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brigadier probably wants to keep him, and his Colonel will raise all
      the different kinds of Cain there are!&rdquo; suggested the man who had begun
      the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen brigadiers before now reduced to a proper sense of their own
      unimportance!&rdquo; remarked another man. And he was connected with the
      Treasury. He knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a week later, when the papers were sent to the Brigadier for
      signature, he amazed everybody by consenting without the least objection.
      Nobody but he knew who his visitor had been the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know about it, Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo; he demanded, as the veteran
      sat and faced him over the tent candle, his one lean leg swaying up and
      down, as usual, above the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have club servants not got ears, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have ears&mdash;good ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Brigadier drummed his fingers on the table, hesitating. No officer,
      however high up in the service, likes to lose even a subaltern from his
      command when that subaltern is worth his salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go, sahib! You have seen how we Rangars honor him&mdash;you may
      guess what difference he might make in a crisis. Sign, sahib&mdash;let him
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;where do you come in? What have you had to do with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, sahib, I tested him thoroughly. I found him good. Second, I told
      tales about him, making him out better than even he is. Third, I made sure
      that all those in authority at Peshawur should hate him. That would have
      been impossible if he had been a fool, or a weak man, or an incompetent;
      but any good man can be hated easily. Fourth, sahib, I sent, by the hand
      of a man of mine, a message to Everton-sahib at Abu reporting to him that
      it was not in Howrah as it should be, and warning him that a sahib should
      be sent there. I knew that he would listen to a hint from me, and I knew
      that he had no one in his office whom he could send. Then, sahib, I
      brought matters to a head by bringing every man of merit whom I could
      raise to salute him and make an outrageous exhibition of him. That is what
      I have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think you were scheming for a throne, Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib, I am scheming for the peace of India! But there will be war
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there will be war,&rdquo; said the Brigadier. &ldquo;I only wish I could make
      the other sahibs realize it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sign the paper, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will sign the paper. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not quite certain that I'm doing right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brigadier-sahib, when the hour comes&mdash;and that is soon&mdash;it will
      be time to answer that! There lie the papers.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>

    Even in darkness lime and sand

    Two by two would equal four
            Under a bucket of water.
</pre>
    <p>
      NOW it may seem unimaginable that two Europeans could be cooped in Howrah,
      not under physical restraint, and yet not able to communicate with any one
      who could render them assistance. It was the case, though, and not by any
      means an isolated case. The policy of the British Government, once
      established in India, was and always has been not to occupy an inch of
      extra territory until compelled by circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The native states, then, while forbidden to contract alliances with one
      another or the world outside, and obliged by the letter of written
      treaties to observe certain fundamental laws imposed on them by the
      Anglo-Indian Government, were left at liberty to govern themselves. And it
      was largely the fact that they could and did keep secret what was going on
      within their borders that enabled the so-called Sepoy Rebellion to get
      such a smouldering foothold before it burst into a blaze. The sepoys were
      the tools of the men behind the movement; and the men behind were priests
      and others who were feeling nothing but their own ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man knows even now how long the fire rebellion had been burning
      underground before showed through the surface; but it is quite obvious
      that, in spite of the heroism shown by British and loyal native alike when
      the crash did come, the rebels must have won&mdash;and have won easily
      sheer weight of numbers&mdash;had they only used the amazing system solely
      for the broad, comprehensive purpose for which it was devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sense of power that its ramifications and extent gave birth to
      also whetted the desires individuals. Each man of any influence at all
      began to scheme to use the system for the furtherance of his individual
      ambition. Instead of bending all their energy and craft to the one great
      object of hurling an unloved conqueror back whence he came, each reigning
      prince strove to scheme himself head and shoulders above the rest; and
      each man who wanted to be prince began to plot harder than ever to be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in Howrah the Maharajah's brother, Jaimihr, with a large following and
      organization of his own, began to use the secret system of which he by
      right formed an integral part and to set wheels working within the wheels
      which in course of time should spew him up on the ledge which his brother
      now occupied. Long before the rebellion was ready he had all his
      preparations made and waited only for the general conflagration to strike
      for his own hand. And was so certain of success that he dared make plans
      as well for Rosemary McClean's fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a blindness, too, quite unexplainable that comes over whole
      nations sometimes. It is almost like a plague in its mysterious arrival
      and departure. As before the French Revolution there were almost none of
      the ruling classes who could read the writing on the wall, so it was in
      India in the spring of '57. Men saw the signs and could not read their
      meaning. As in France, so in India, there were a few who understood, but
      they were scoffed at; the rest&mdash;the vast majority who held the reins
      of power&mdash;were blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary McClean discovered that her pony had gone lame, and was angry
      with the groom. The groom ran away, and she put that down to native
      senselessness. Duncan McClean sent one after another of the little native
      children to find him a man who would take a letter to Mount Abu. The
      children went and did not come back again, and he put that down to the
      devil, who would seem to have reclaimed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them saw the watchers, posted at every vantage-point, insolently
      wakeful; both of them knew that Jaimihr had placed them there. But neither
      of them looked one inch deeper than the surface, nor supposed that their
      presence betokened anything but the prince's unreachable ambition. Neither
      of them thought for an instant that the day could possibly have come when
      Britain would be unable to protect a woman of its own race, or when a
      native&mdash;however powerful&mdash;would dare to do more than threaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna disappeared, and that led to a chain of thought which was not
      creditable to any one concerned. They reasoned this way: Rosemary had seen
      Mahommed Gunga hold out a handful of gold coins for the old woman's eyes
      to glitter at, therefore it was fair to presume that he had promised her a
      reward for bringing word to the man whom, it was now known, he had left
      behind. She had brought word to him and had disappeared. What more obvious
      than to reason that the man had gladly paid her, and had just as gladly
      ridden off, rejoicing at the thought that he could escape doing service?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much,&rdquo; they argued, &ldquo;for native constancy! So much for Mahommed
      Gunga's boast that he knew of men who could be trusted! And so much for
      Joanna's gratitude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had been saved by Rosemary McClean from the long-drawn-out
      hell that is the life portion of most Indian widows, even of low caste;
      she had had little to do, ever, beyond snooze in the shade and eat, and
      run sometimes behind the pony&mdash;a task which came as easily to her as
      did the other less active parts of her employment. Her desertion,
      particularly at a crisis, made Rosemary McClean cry, and set her father to
      quoting Shakespeare's &ldquo;King Lear.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Blow, blow, thou winter wind!
    Thou art not so unkind
    As man's ingratitude!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All Scotsmen seem to have a natural proclivity for quoting the appropriate
      dirge when sorrow shows itself. The Book of Lamentations&mdash;Shakespeare's
      sadder lines&mdash;roll off their tongues majestically and seem to give
      them consolation&mdash;as it were to lay a sound, unjoyous basis for the
      proper enjoyment of the songs of Robbie Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old king of the poet's imagining, declaiming up above the cliffs
      of Dover, could have put no more pathos into those immortal lines than did
      Duncan McClean as he paced up and down between the hot wars of the
      darkened room. The dry air parched his throat, and his ambition seemed to
      shrivel in him as he saw the brave little woman who was all he had sobbing
      with her head between her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the Bible, but he could find no precedent in any of its pages
      for abandoning a quest like his in the teeth of disaster or adversity. He
      read it for hour after crackling hour, moistening his throat from time to
      time with warm, unappetizing water from the improvised jar filter; but
      when the oven blast that makes the Indian summer day a hell on earth had
      waned and died away, he had found nothing but admonishment to stand firm.
      There had been women, too, whose deeds were worthy of record in that book,
      and he found no argument for deserting his post on his daughter's account
      either. In the Bible account, as he read it, it had always been the devil
      who fled when things got too uncomfortable for him, and he was conscious
      of a tight-lipped, stern contempt for the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had about made up his mind what line to take with his daughter, when
      she ceased her sobbing and looked up through swollen eyes to relieve him
      of the necessity for talking her over to his point view. What she said
      amazed him, but not be cause it came to him as a new idea. She said, in
      different words, exactly what was passing in his own mind, and it was as
      though her tears and his search of the Scriptures had brought them both to
      one clear-cut conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are we here, father?&rdquo; she asked him suddenly; and because she took
      him by surprise he did not answer her at once. &ldquo;We are here to do good
      aren't we?&rdquo; That was no question; it was beginning of a line of argument.
      Her father held his tongue, and laid his Bible down, and listened on. &ldquo;How
      much good have we done yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, but the pause was rhetorical, and he knew it; he could see the
      light behind her eyes that was more than visionary; it was the light of
      practical Scots enthusiasm, unquenched and undiscouraged after a battle
      with fear itself. She began to be beautiful again as the spirit of
      unconquerable courage won its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we won one convert? Is there one, of those you have taught who is
      with us still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was self-evident. There was none. But there was no sting for
      him in what she asked. Rather her words came as a relief, for he could
      feel the strength behind them. He still said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we stopped one single suttee? Have we once, in any least degree,
      lessened the sufferings of one of those poor widows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not once,&rdquo; he answered her, without a trace of shame. He knew, and she
      knew, how hard the two of them had tried. There was nothing to apologize
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we undermined the power of the Hindoo priests? Have we removed one
      trace of superstition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we given up the fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked hard at her. Gray eyes under gray brows met gray eyes that shone
      from under dark, wet lashes, and deep spoke unto deep. Scotsman recognized
      Scotswoman, and the bond between them tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me&rdquo;&mdash;there was a new thrill in her voice&mdash;&ldquo;that
      here is our opportunity! Either Jaimihr wants to frighten us away or he is
      in earnest with his impudent attentions to me. In either case let us make
      no attempt to go away. Let us refuse to go away. Let us stay here at all
      costs. If he wishes us to go away, then he must have a reason and will
      show it, or else try to force us. If he is really trying to make love to
      me, then let him try; if he has pluck enough, let him seize me. In either
      case we shall force his hand. I am willing to be the bait. The moment that
      he harms either you or me, the government will have to interfere. If he
      kills us so much the better, for that would mean swift vengeance and a
      British occupation. That would stop suttee for all time, and we would have
      given our lives for something worth while. As we are, we cannot
      communicate with our government, and Jaimihr thinks he has us in his
      grasp. Let him think it! Let him go ahead! Sooner or later the government
      must find out that we are missing Then&mdash;!&rdquo; Her eyes blazed at the
      thought of what would happen then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father looked at her for about a minute, sadness and pride in her
      fighting in him for the mastery. Then he rose and crossed the little space
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lassie!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lassie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand&mdash;the one little touch of human sentiment lacking to
      disturb his emotional balance. The Scots will talk readily enough of
      sorrow, but at showing it they are a grudging race of men. Unless a
      Scotsman thinks he can gain something for his cause by showing what
      emotion racks him, he will swallow down the choking flood of grief, and
      keep a straight face to the world and his own as well. Duncan McClean
      turned from her&mdash;drew his hand away&mdash;and walked to open the slit
      shutters. A moment later he came back, once more master of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As things are, dear,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;how would it be possible for us to
      get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We canna gang awa'!&rdquo; she quoted, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO, lassie. We must stay here and be brave. This matter is not in our
      hands. We must wait, and watch, and see. If opportunity should come to us
      to make our escape, we will seize it. Should it not come&mdash;should
      Jaimihr, or some other of them, make occasion to molest us&mdash;it may be&mdash;it
      might be that&mdash;surely the day of martyrs is not past&mdash;it might
      be that&mdash;well, well, in either case we will eventually win. Should
      they kill us, the government must send here to avenge us; should we get
      away, surely our report will be listened to. A month or two&mdash;perhaps
      only a week or two&mdash;even a day or two, who knows?&mdash;and the last
      suttee will have been performed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood and stroked her head&mdash;then stooped and kissed it&mdash;an
      unusual betrayal of emotion from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're a brave lassie,&rdquo; he said, leaving the room hurriedly, to escape the
      shame of letting her see tears welling from his eyes&mdash;salt tears that
      scalded as they broke their hot-wind-wearied bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later she arose, dry-eyed, and went to stand in the doorway,
      where an eddy or two of lukewarm evening breeze might possibly be
      stirring. But a dirtily clad Hindoo, lounging on a raised, railless store
      veranda opposite, leered at her impudently, and she came inside again&mdash;to
      pass the evening and the sultry, black, breathless night out of sight, at
      least, of the brutes who shut her off from even exercise.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    So, I am a dog? Hence I must come
            To do thy bidding faster?
    Must tell thee&mdash;Nay, a dog stays dumb!
            A dog obeys one master!
</pre>
    <p>
      NOT many yards from where the restless elephants stood lined under big
      brick arches&mdash;in an age-old courtyard, three sides of which were
      stone-carved splendor and the fourth a typically Eastern mess of stables,
      servants' quarters, litter, stink, and noisy confusion&mdash;a stone door,
      slab-hewn, gave back the aching glitter of the sun. Its only opening&mdash;a
      narrow slit quite near the top&mdash;was barred. A man&mdash;his face
      close-pressed against them&mdash;peered through the interwoven iron rods
      from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr, in a rose-pink pugree still, but not at all the swaggering
      cavalier who pranced, high-booted, through the streets&mdash;a
      down-at-heel prince, looking slovenly and heavy-eyed from too much opium&mdash;sat
      in a long chair under the cloister which faced the barred stone door. He
      swished with a rhino riding-whip at the stone column beside him, and the
      much-swathed individual of the plethoric paunch who stood and spoke with
      him kept a very leery eye on it; he seemed to expect the binding swish of
      it across his own shins, and the thought seemed tantalizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to be done,&rdquo; said Jaimihr, speaking in a dialect peculiar to
      Howrah. &ldquo;That&mdash;of all the idiotic notions I have listened to&mdash;is
      the least worth while! Thy brains are in thy belly and are lost amid the
      fat! If my brother Howrah only had such counsellors as thou&mdash;such
      monkey folk to make his plans for him&mdash;the jackals would have
      finished with him long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, did I not bring word, and overhear, and trap the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly! Overheard whisperings, and trapped me a hyena I must feed! Now
      thou sayest, 'Torture him!' He is a Rangar, and of good stock; therefore,
      no amount of torturing will make him speak. He is that pig Mahommed
      Gunga's man; therefore, there' is nothing more sure than that Mahommed
      Gunga will be here, sooner or later, to look for him&mdash;Mahommed Gunga,
      with the half of a Hindoo name, the whole of a Moslem's fire, and the
      blind friendship of the British to rely on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the man be dead when Mahommed Gunga comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be dead when Mahommed Gunga comes, if only what we await has
      first happened. But this rising that is planned hangs fire. Were I
      Maharajah I would like to see the Rangar who dare flout me or ask
      questions! I would like but to set eyes on that Rangar once! But I am not
      yet Maharajah; I am a prince&mdash;a younger brother&mdash;surrounded,
      counselled, impeded, hampered, rendered laughable by fat idiots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My belly but shows your highness's generosity. At whose cost have I grown
      fat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, at whose cost? I should have kept thee slim, on prison diet, and
      saved myself a world of useless problems! Cease prattling! Get away from
      me! If I have to poison this Ali Partab, or wring his casteless neck, I
      will make thee do it, and give thee to Mahommed Gunga to wreak vengeance
      on. Leave me to think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat former occupant of the room above the arch of the caravansary
      waddled to the far end of the cloister, and sat down, cross-legged, to
      grumble to himself and scratch his paunch at intervals. His master,
      low-browed and irritable, continued to strike the stone column with his
      cane. He was in a horrid quandary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga was one of many men he did not want, for the present, to
      offend seriously. Given a fair cause for quarrel, that irascible
      ex-Risaldar was capable of going to any lengths, and was known, moreover,
      to be trusted by the British. Nobody seemed to know whether or not
      Mahommed Gunga reciprocated the British regard, and nobody had cared to
      ask him except his own intimates; and they, like he, were men of close
      counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince had given no orders for the capture of Ali Partab; that had
      been carried out by his men in a fit of ill-advised officiousness. But the
      Prince had to solve the serious problem caused by the presence of Ali
      Partab within a stone-walled cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he let the fellow go, a report would be certain to reach Mahommed
      Gunga by the speediest route. Vengeance would be instantly decided on, for
      a Rajput does not merely accept service; he repays it, feudal-wise, and
      smites hip and thigh for the honor of his men. The vengeance would be sure
      to follow purely Eastern lines, and would be complicated; it would no
      doubt take the form of siding in some way or other with his brother the
      Maharajah. There would be instant, active doings, for that was Mahommed
      Gunga's style! The fat would be in the fire months, perhaps, before the
      proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner's presence was maddening in a million ways. It had been the
      Prince's plan (for he knew well enough that Mahommed Gunga had left a man
      behind) to allow the escape to start; then it would have been an easy
      matter to arrange an ambush&mdash;to kill Ali Partab&mdash;and to pretend
      to ride to the rescue. Once rescued, Miss McClean and her father would be
      almost completely at his mercy, for they would not be able to accuse him
      of anything but friendliness, and would be obliged to return to whatever
      haven of safety he cared to offer them. Once in his palace of their own
      consent, they would have had to stay there until the rising of the whole
      of India put an end to any chance of interference from the British
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now there was no Ali Partab outside to try to escort them to some
      place of safety; therefore, there was little chance that the missionaries
      would try to make a bolt. Instead of being in the position of a cat that
      watches silently and springs when the mouse breaks cover, he was in the
      unenviable condition now of being forced to make the first move. Over and
      over again he cursed the men who had made Ali Partab prisoner, and over
      and over again: he wondered how&mdash;by all the gods of all the
      multitudinous Hindoo mythology&mdash;how, when, and by what stroke of
      genius he could make use of the stiff-chinned Rangar and convert him from
      being a rankling thorn into a useful aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dared not poison him&mdash;yet. For the same reason he dared not put
      him to the torture, to discover, or try to discover, what Mahommed Gunga's
      real leanings were in the matter of loyalty to the Raj or otherwise. He
      dared not let the man go, for forgiveness is not one of the virtues held
      in high esteem by men of Ali Partab's race, and wrongful arrest is
      considered ground enough for a feud to the death. It seemed he did not
      dare do anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      He racked his opium-dulled brain for a suspicion of a plan that might help
      solve the difficulty, until his eye&mdash;wandering around the courtyard&mdash;fell
      on the black shape of a woman. She was old and bent and she was busied,
      with a handful of dry twigs, pretending to sweep around the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that mother of corruption?&rdquo; demanded Jaimihr; and a man came
      running to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that eyesore? I have never seen her, have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highness, she is a beggar woman. She sat by the gate, and pretended to a
      power of telling fortunes&mdash;which it would seem she does possess in
      some degree. It was thought better that she should use her gift in here,
      for our advantage, than outside to our disadvantage. So she was brought in
      and set to sweeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the curse of the sin of the sack of Chitor, is my palace, then, a
      midden for the crawling offal of all the Howrah streets? First this Rangar&mdash;next
      a sweeper hag&mdash;what follows? What bring you next? Go, fetch the
      street dogs in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highness, she is useful and costs nothing but the measure or two of meal
      she eats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse eats little more!&rdquo; the angry Prince retorted, perfectly
      accustomed to being argued with by his own servants. That is the
      time-honored custom of the East; obedience is one thing&mdash;argument
      another&mdash;both in their way are good, and both have their innings.
      &ldquo;Bring her to me&mdash;nay!&mdash;keep her at a decent distance&mdash;so!&mdash;am
      I dirt for her broom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat and scowled at her, and the old woman tried to hide more of her
      protruding bones under the rag of clothing that she wore; she stood,
      wriggling in evident embarrassment, well out in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What willst thou steal of mine?&rdquo; the Prince demanded suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no thief.&rdquo; Bright, beady eyes gleamed back at him, and gave the lie
      direct to her shrinking attitude of fear. But he had taken too much opium
      overnight, and was in no mood to notice little distinctions. He was
      satisfied that she should seem properly afraid of him, and he scowled
      angrily when one of his retainers&mdash;in slovenly undress&mdash;crossed
      the courtyard to him. The man's evident intention, made obvious by his
      manner and his leer at the old woman, was to say something against her;
      the Prince was in a mood to quarrel with any one, on any ground at all,
      who did not cower to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, she it is who ran ever with the white woman, as a dog runs in the
      dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her!&rdquo; grinned the trooper. &ldquo;Unless she comes to look for Ali Partab,
      I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made the last part of his remark in a hurried undertone, too low for
      the old woman to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her earn her meal around the stables,&rdquo; said the Prince. A sudden
      light dawned on him. Here was a means, at least, of trying to make use of
      Ali Partab. &ldquo;Go&mdash;do thy sweeping!&rdquo; he commanded, and the hag slunk
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten minutes longer, Jaimihr sat still and flicked at the stone column
      with his whip,&mdash;then he sent for his master of the horse, whose
      mistaken sense of loyalty had been the direct cause of Ali Partab's
      capture. He had acted instantly when the fat Hindoo brought him word, and
      he had expected to be praised for quick decision and rewarded; he was
      plainly in high dudgeon as he swaggered out of a dark door near the
      stables and advanced sulkily toward his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove the prisoner from that cell, taking great care that the hag yonder
      sees what you do&mdash;yes, that hag&mdash;the new one; she is a spy.
      Bring the prisoner in to me, where I will talk with him; afterward place
      him in a different cell&mdash;put him where we kept the bear that died&mdash;there
      is a dark comer beside it, where a man might hide; hide a man there when
      it grows dark. And give the hag access. Say nothing to her; let her come
      and go as she will; watch, and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word, the Prince got up and shuffled in his decorated
      slippers to a door at one end of the cloister. Five minutes later Ali
      Partab&mdash;high-chinned, but looking miserable&mdash;was led between two
      men through the same door, while the old woman went on very ostentatiously
      with her sweeping about the yard. She even turned her back, to prove how
      little she was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab was hustled forward into a high-ceilinged room, whose light
      came filtered through a scrollwork mesh of chiselled stone where the wall
      and ceiling joined. There were no windows, but six doors opened from it,
      and every one of them was barred, as though they opened into
      treasure-vaults. The Prince sat restlessly in a high, carved wooden chair;
      there was no other furniture at all, and Ali Partab was left standing
      between his guards. The Prince drew a pistol from inside his clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us alone!&rdquo; he ordered; and the guards went out, closing the door
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave no orders for your capture,&rdquo; said Jaimihr, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, let me go,&rdquo; grinned Ali Partab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I must be informed on certain matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab still grinned, but the muscles of his face changed their
      position slightly, and it took no expert in physiognomy to read that
      questions he would answer must be very tactfully asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mahommed Gunga's man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is an honorable service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he order you to stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;in this palace? Allah forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he order you to stay in Howrah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me certain orders. I obeyed them until your men invited swift
      death for themselves and you by interfering with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were the orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab grinned again&mdash;this time insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make sure that the Jaimihr-sahib did not make away with the treasure
      of his brother Howrah!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were released now what would you proceed to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To obey my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr changed his tactics and assumed the frequently successful legal
      line of pretending to know far more than he really did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told by one who overheard you speak that you were to take the
      missionary and his daughter to Alwa's place. How much is my brother Howrah
      paying for Mahommed Gunga's services in this matter? It is well known that
      he and Alwa between them could call out all the Rangars in the district
      for whichever side they chose. Since they are not on my side, they must be
      for Howrah. How much does he pay? I might offer more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Ali Partab, perfectly ready to admit anything that was
      not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, then, that Howrah has designs on the missionary's daughter?
      Alwa is to keep her prisoner until the great blow is struck, and Howrah
      dare take possession of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not my business,&rdquo; answered Ali Partab, with the air of a man who
      knew all of the secret details but would not admit it. Jaimihr began to
      think that he had lit at random on the answer to the riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Alwa's place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I God that I should know where any man is whom I cannot see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So he is at Alwa's, eh?&rdquo; That overdose of opium had rendered
      Jaimihr's brain very dull indeed; he considered himself clever, and
      overlooked the fact that Ali Partab would be almost surely lying to him.
      In India men never tell the truth to chance-met strangers or to their
      enemies; the truth is a valuable thing, to be shared cautiously among
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mahommed Gunga is at Alwa's,&rdquo; reasoned Jaimihr, &ldquo;then he is much too
      close at hand to take any chances with. I must keep this man close
      confined.&rdquo; He raised his voice in a high-pitched command, and the guards
      opened the door instantly; at a sign from the Prince they seized Ali
      Partab by the wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send a message to Mahommed Gunga for thee,&rdquo; said Jaimihr. &ldquo;On his
      answer will depend your release or otherwise.&rdquo; He nodded. The guards took
      their prisoner out between them&mdash;led him past the wrinkled old woman
      in the courtyard&mdash;and halted him in a far corner, where an
      evil-smelling cage of a place stood open to receive him. A moment later,
      in order to make sure, the master of the horse sent for the old woman and
      made her sweep out the cell a little; then he drove her away with a fierce
      injunction not to let herself be caught anywhere near the cell again
      unless ordered. Following the line of eastern reasoning, had he not given
      that order he would not have known what her object could be should she
      make her way toward the cell; but now, if she risked his wrath by
      disobeying, he would know beyond the least shadow of a doubt that she had
      a message to deliver to the prisoner&mdash;the man who was hidden in the
      dark corner need entertain no hope of keeping the secret to himself for
      purposes of sale or blackmail!
    </p>
    <p>
      They trust each other wonderfully&mdash;with an almost childlike
      confidence&mdash;in a household such as Jaimihr's!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Ho! I am king! All lesser fry
            Must cringe, and crawl, and cry to me,
    And none have any rights but I,&mdash;
            Except the right to lie to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      JAIMIHR was not the only man who would have dearly liked to know of the
      whereabouts of Mahommed Gunga. It had been reported to Maharajah Howrah,
      by his spies, that the redoubtable ex-Risaldar of horse had visited his
      relatives in Howrah City, and, though he had not been able to ascertain a
      word of what had passed, he was none the less anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, of course&mdash;for every soul in Howrah knew&mdash;that Jaimihr
      was plotting for the throne. He knew, too, that the priests of Siva, who
      with himself were joint keepers of the wickedly won, tax-swollen treasure,
      had sounded Jaimihr; they had tentatively hinted that they might espouse
      his cause, provided that an equitable division of the treasure were
      arranged beforehand. The question uppermost in Maharajah Howrah's mind was
      whether the Rangars&mdash;the Moslem descendants of once Hindoo Rajputs,
      who formed such a small but valuable proportion of the local population&mdash;could
      or could not be induced to throw in their lot with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man on the whole tax-ridden countryside believed or considered it as a
      distant possibility that the Rangars would strike for any hand except
      their own; they were known, on the other hand, to be more or less
      cohesive, and it was considered certain that, whichever way they swung,
      when the priest-pulled string let loose the flood of revolution, they
      would swing all together. The question, then, was how to win the favor of
      the Rangars. It was not at all an easy question, for the love lost between
      Hindoos and Mohammedans is less than that between dark-skinned men and
      white&mdash;a lot less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two hours of its happening he had been told of the capture of Ali
      Partab; and he knew&mdash;for that was another thing his spies had told
      him&mdash;that Ali Partab was Mahommed Gunga's man. Apparently, then, Ali
      Partab&mdash;a prisoner in Jaimihr's palace-yard&mdash;was the only
      connecting link between him and the Rangars whom he wished to win over to
      his side. He was as anxious as any to help overwhelm the British, but he
      naturally wished to come out of the turmoil high and dry himself, and he
      was, therefore, ready to consider the protection of individual British
      subjects if that would please the men whom he wanted for his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga was known to have carried letters for the missionaries. He
      was known to have engaged a new servant when he rode away from Howrah and
      to have left his trusted man behind. Miss McClean was known to have
      conversed with the retainer, immediately after which the man had been
      seized and carried off by Jaimihr's men. Jaimihr was known to have placed
      watchers round the mission house and&mdash;once&mdash;to have killed a man
      in Miss McClean's defense. The deduction was not too far-fetched that the
      retainer had been left as a protection against Jaimihr, and consequently
      that the Rangars, at the behest of Mahommed Gunga, had decided&mdash;on at
      least the white girl's safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, he argued, if he now proceeded to protect the McCleans, he
      would, at all events, not incur the Rangars' enmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a serious decision that he had to make, for, for one thing, he
      dared not yet make any move likely to incite his strongly supported
      brother to open rebellion; he dared not, therefore, interfere at present
      with the watchers near the mission house. To openly befriend the Christian
      priests would be to set the whole Hindoo population against himself, for
      it had been mainly against suttee and its kindred horrors that the
      missionaries had bent all their energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great palace of Howrah was ahum. Elephants with painted tusks, and
      loaded to the groaning-point under howdahs decked with jewels and
      gold-leaf, came and went through the carved entrance-gates. Occasionally
      camels, loaded too until their legs all but buckled underneath them,
      strutted with their weird, mixed air of foolishness and dignity, to be
      disburdened of great cases that eight men could scarcely lift; on the
      outside the cases were marked &ldquo;Hardware,&rdquo; but a horde of armed and waiting
      malcontents scattered about the countryside could have given a more
      detailed and accurate guess at what was in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men came and went&mdash;men almost of all castes and many nationalities.
      Priests&mdash;not all of them fat, but every single one fat-smiling&mdash;sunned
      themselves, or waited in the shade until they could have audience; no
      priest of any Hindoo temple had to wait long to be admitted to that
      Rajah's presence, and there was an everlasting chain of them, each with
      his axe to grind, coming and going by day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color rioted in the blazing sun and deep, dark shadows lurked in all the
      thousand places where the sun could never penetrate. It was India in
      essence&mdash;noise and blaze and flouted splendor, with a back-ground and
      underground of mystery. Any but the purblind British could have told at
      half a glance, merely by the attitude of Howrah's armed sepoys, that a
      concerted movement of some kind was afoot&mdash;that there was a
      tight-held thread of plan running through the whole confusion; but no man&mdash;not
      even a native&mdash;could have guessed what secret plotting might be going
      on within the acres of the straggling palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the courtyard there was no least hint obtainable even of the
      building's size; its shape could only have been marked down from a
      bird's-eye view aloft. Even the roof was so uneven, and so subdivided by
      traced and deep-carved walls and ramparts, that a sentry posted at one end
      could not have seen the next man to him, perhaps some twenty feet away.
      Building had been piled on building&mdash;other buildings had been added
      end to end and crisscrosswise&mdash;and each extension had been walled in
      as new centuries saw new additions, until the many acres were a maze of
      bricks and stone and fountain-decorated gardens that no lifelong palace
      denizen could have learned to know in their entirety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within&mdash;one story up above the courtyard din&mdash;in a spacious,
      richly decorated room that gave on to a gorgeous roof-garden, the
      Maharajah sat and let himself be fanned by women, who were purchasable for
      perhaps a tenth of what any of the fans had cost. Another woman, younger
      than the rest, played wild minor music to him on an instrument not much
      unlike a flute; they were melancholy notes&mdash;beautiful&mdash;but sad
      enough to sow pessimism's seed in any one who listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      His divan&mdash;carved, inlaid, and gilded&mdash;faced the wide,
      awning-hung opening to the garden. Round him on all three sides was a
      carved stone screen through whose interstices came rustlings and
      whisperings that told of the hidden life which sees and is not seen. The
      women with the fans and flute were mere court accessories; the real nerves
      of Asia&mdash;the veiled intriguers whom none may know but whose secret
      power any man may feel&mdash;could be heard like caged birds crowding on
      their perches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then glass bracelets tinkled from behind the screen; ever and
      again the music stopped, until another girl appeared to play another
      melancholy air. But the even purring of the fans went on incessantly, and
      the poor, priest-ridden fool who owned it all scowled straight in front of
      him, his brows lined deep in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a strange malady, that which seizes men whom fate has elevated to a
      throne. It acts as certain Indian drugs are known to do&mdash;deprives its
      victim of the power to act, but intensifies his ability to think, and
      theorize, and feel. Howrah, with untold treasure in his vaults, with an
      army of five thousand men, with the authority and backing that a hundred
      generations give, could long for more&mdash;could fear the loss of what he
      did have&mdash;but could not act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests held him fear-bound. His brother held him hate-bound. His
      women&mdash;and not even he knew, probably, how many of them languished in
      the secret warren inside those palace walls&mdash;kept him restless in a
      net of this-and-that-way-tugged intrigue. Flattery&mdash;and that is by
      far the subtlest poison of the East&mdash;blinded him utterly to his own
      best course, and kept him blind. Luxury unmanned him; he who had once held
      the straightest spear in western India, and for the love of feeling red
      blood racing in his veins had ridden down panthers on the maidan, was
      flabby now; deep, dark rings underlined his eyes and the once
      steel-sinewed wrist trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother Jaimihr in his place, unsapped yet by decadent delights, would
      have loosed his five thousand on the countryside&mdash;butchered any who
      opposed him&mdash;pressed into service those who merely lagged&mdash;and
      would have plunged India in a welter of blood before the priests had time
      to mature their plans and arrange to keep all the power and plunder to
      themselves. But Jaimihr had to stalk lesser game and content himself with
      pricking at the ever-growing hate that gradually rendered the Maharajah
      decisionless and sorry only for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A first glimpse at Howrah, particularly in the shaded room, showed a
      handsome man, black-bearded, lean, and lithe; a second look, undazzled by
      his jewelry or by the studied magnificence of each apparently unstudied
      movement, betrayed a man whose lightest word was law, but who feared to
      give the word. Where muscles had been were unfilled folds of skin that
      shook; where a firm if selfish mouth had once smiled merrily beneath a
      pointed black mustache, a mouth still smiled, but meanly; the selfishness
      was there, but the firmness had faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, though, were his most marked feature. They were hungry eyes,
      pathetic as a caged beast's and as savage. No one could see them without
      pitying him, and no man in his senses would have accepted their owner's
      word on any point at all. A man looks as he did when the fire of a burning
      velt has circled him and there is no way out. There was fear behind them,
      and the look of restless search for safety that is nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the many-columned courtyards of the palace was a chained, mad
      elephant whose duty was to kneel on the Rajah's captive enemies. In
      another courtyard was a big, square tank with a weedy, slippery stone ramp
      at one end; in the tank were alligators; down the ramp other of the
      Rajah's enemies, tight-bound, would scream and struggle and slide from
      time to time. But they were only little enemies who died in that way; the
      greater ones, who had power or influence, lived on and plotted, because
      the owner of the execution beasts was afraid to put them to their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, in damp, unlit dungeons, there were silken cords suspended from
      stone ceilings; their ends were noosed, and the nooses hung ten feet above
      the floor; those told only, though, of the fate of women who had schemed
      unwisely&mdash;favorites of a week, perhaps, who had dared to sulk,
      listeners through screens who had forgotten to forget. No men died ever by
      the silken cord, and no tales ever reached the outside world of who did
      die down in the echoing brick cellars; there was a path that led
      underground to the alligator tank and a trap-door that opened just above
      the water edge. Night, and the fungus-fouled long jaws, and slimy,
      weed-filled water&mdash;the creak of rusty hinges&mdash;a splash&mdash;the
      bang of a falling trap&mdash;a swirl in the moonlit water, and ring after
      heavy, widening ring that lapped at last against the stone would write
      conclusion to a tragedy. There would be no record kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howrah was childless. That, of all the hell-sent troubles that beset him,
      was the worst. That alone was worse than the hoarded treasure whose secret
      he and his brother and the priests of Siva shared. Only in India could it
      happen that a line of Rajahs, drag-net-armed&mdash;oblivious to the duties
      of a king and greedy only of the royal right to tax&mdash;could pile up,
      century by century, a hoard of gold an jewels&mdash;to be looked at. The
      secret of that treasure made the throne worth plotting for&mdash;gave the
      priests, who shared the secret, more than nine tenths of their power for
      blackmail, pressure, and intrigue&mdash;and grew, like a cancer, into each
      succeeding Rajah's mind until, from a man with a soul inside him he became
      in turn a heartless, fear ridden miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any childless king is liable to feel the insolent expectancy betrayed by
      the heir apparent. But Jaimihr&mdash;who had no sons either&mdash;was an
      heir who understood all of the Indian arts whereby a man of brain may
      hasten the succession. Worry, artfully stirred up, is the greatest weapon
      of them all, and never a day passed but some cleverly concocted tale would
      reach the Rajah, calculated to set his guessing faculties at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either of the brothers, when he happened to be thirsty, would call his
      least-trusted counsellor to drink first from the jewelled cup, and would
      watch the man afterward for at least ten minutes before daring to slake
      his thirst; but Jaimihr had the moral advantage of an aspirant; Howrah, on
      the defensive, wilted under the nibbling necessity for wakefulness, while
      Jaimihr grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were five thousand drilled, armed men to a king who feared to use
      them? Of what use was a waiting countryside, armed if not drilled, if he
      was not sure that his brother had not won every man's allegiance? Being
      Hindoo, priest-reared, priest-fooled, and priest-flattered, he knew, or
      thought he knew, to an anna the value he might set on Hindoo loyalty or on
      the loyalty of any man who did not stand to gain in pocket by remaining
      true; and, as many another fear-sick tyrant has begun to do, he turned, in
      his mind at least, to men of another creed&mdash;which in India means of
      another race, practically-wondering whether he could not make use of them
      against his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like every other Rajah of his line, he longed to have sole control of that
      wonderful treasure that had eaten out his very manhood. Miser though he
      was, he was prepared at least to bargain with outsiders with the promise
      of a portion of it, if that would give him possession of it all. He had
      learned from the priests who took such full advantage of him an absolute
      contempt for Mohammedans; and their teaching, as well as his own trend of
      character, made him quite indifferent to promises he might make, for the
      sake of diplomacy, to men of another creed. It began to be obvious to him
      that he would lose nothing by courting the favor of the Rangars, and of
      Alwa in particular, and that he might win security by coaxing them to take
      his part. Of one thing he was certain: the Rangars would do anything at
      all, if by doing it they could harm the Hindoo priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, being of the East Eastern, and at that Hindoo, he could not have
      brought himself to make overtures direct and go straight to the real
      issue. He had to feel his way gingerly. The thousand horses in his
      stables, he reflected, would mount a thousand of the Rangars and place at
      his disposal a regiment of cavalry which would be difficult to beat; but a
      thousand mounted Mohammedans might be a worse thorn in his side than even
      his brother or the priests. He decided to write to Alwa, but to open
      negotiations with a very thin and delicately inserted wedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could write. The priests had overlooked that opportunity, and had
      taught him in his boyhood; in that one thing he was their equal. But the
      other things that they had taught him, too, offset his penmanship. He was
      too proud to write&mdash;too lazy, too enamoured of his dignity. He called
      a court official, and the man sat very humbly at his feet&mdash;listened
      meekly to the stern command to secrecy&mdash;and took the letter from
      dictation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa was informed, quite briefly, that in view of certain happenings in
      Howrah City His Highness the Maharajah had considered it expedient to set
      a guard over the Christian missionaries in the city, for their safety. The
      accompanying horse was a gift to the Alwa-sahib. The Alwa-sahib himself
      would be a welcome guest whenever he might care to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document was placed in a silver tube and scaled. Within the space of
      half an hour a horseman was kicking up the desert dust, riding as though
      he carried news of life-and-death importance, and with another man and a
      led horse galloping behind him. Five minutes after the man had started, in
      a cell below the temple, of Siva, the court official who had taken down
      the letter was repeating it word for word to a congeries of priests. And
      one hour later still, in a room up near the roof of Jaimihr's palace, one
      of the priests&mdash;panting from having come so fast&mdash;was asking the
      Rajah's brother what he thought about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say nothing&mdash;,&rdquo; asked Jaimihr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest watched him eagerly; he would have to bear back to the other
      priests an exact account of the Prince's every word, and movement, and
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I, too, say nothing!&rdquo; answered Jaimihr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to the priests of Siva, who are waiting, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them I said nothing.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Eyes in the dark, awake and keen,
            See and may not themselves be seen;
    But&mdash;and this is the tale I tell&mdash;
            What if the dark have eyes as well?
</pre>
    <p>
      BESIDE the reeking bear's cage in which Ali Partab stood and swore was a
      dark, low corner space in which at one time and another sacks and useless
      impedimenta had been tossed, to become rat-eaten and decayed. In among all
      the rubbish, cross-legged like the idol of the underworld, a nearly naked
      Hindoo sat, prick-eared. He was quite invisible long before the sun went
      down, for that was the dingiest corner of the yard; when twilight came, he
      could not have been seen from a dozen feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, sweeping, sweeping, sweeping, in the courtyard, with her back very
      nearly always turned toward the cage, appeared to take no notice of the
      falling darkness; unlike the other menials, who hurried to their rest and
      evening meal, she went on working, accomplishing very little but seeming
      to be very much in earnest about it all. Very, very gradually she drew
      nearer to the cage. When night fell, she was within ten feet of it. A few
      lamps were lit then, here and there over doorways, but nobody appeared to
      linger in the courtyard; no footfalls resounded; nothing but the neigh of
      stabled horses and the chatter around the big, flat supper pans broke on
      the evening quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna drew nearer. Ali Partab came forward to the cage bars, but said
      nothing; it was very dark inside the cage, and even the sharp-eyed old
      woman could not possibly have seen his gestures; when he stood,
      tight-pressed, against the bars she might have made out his dark shape
      dimly, but unless he chose to speak no signal could possibly have passed
      from him to her. He said nothing, though, and she-still sweeping, with her
      back toward him&mdash;passed by the cage, and stooped to scratch at some
      hard-caked dirt or other close to the rubbish hole where the Hindoo
      waited. Still scratching, still working with her twig broom, still with
      her back toward the rubbish hole, she approached until the darkest shadow
      swallowed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two in the dark then&mdash;she and the man who listened. He,
      motionless as stone, had watched her; peering outward at the lesser
      darkness, he lost sight of her for a second as she backed into the deepest
      shadow unexpectedly. Before he could become accustomed to the altered
      focus and the deeper black, her beady eyes picked out the whites of his.
      Before he could move she was on him&mdash;at his throat, tearing it with
      thin, steel fingers. Before he could utter a sound, or move, she had drawn
      a short knife from her clothing and had driven it to the hilt below his
      ear. He dropped without a gurgle, and without a sound she gathered up her
      broom again and swept her way back past the cage-bars, where Ali Partab
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was any there?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now will the reward be three mohurs instead of two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These pigs have taken all the money from me. Now we must wait until
      Mahommed Gunga-sahib comes. His word is pledged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said two mohurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;Ali Partab&mdash;pledge his word for three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who art thou? The bear in the cage said: 'I will eat thee if I get
      outside!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother of corruption! Listen! Alwa must know! Canst thou escape from
      here? Canst thou reach the Alwa-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the price were four mohurs, there might be many things that I could
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price is three! I have spoken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I would eat honey were I outside!' said the bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hag! The bear died in the cage, and they sold his pelt for how much?
      Alive, he had been worth three mohurs, but he died while they bargained
      for him!&mdash;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am black, sahib, and the night is black. I am old, and none would
      believe me active. They watch the gates, but the bats fly in and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out, then, what has happened to my horses, left at the caravansary;
      give that information to the Alwa-sahib. Tell the Miss-sahib at the
      mission where I am. Tell her whither I have sent thee. Tell the Alwa-sahib
      that a Rangar&mdash;by name Ali Partab&mdash;sworn follower of the
      prophet, and servant of the Risaldar Mahommed Gunga&mdash;is in need and
      asks his instant aid. Say also to the Alwa-sahib that it may be well to
      rescue the Miss-sahib first, before he looks for me, but of that matter I
      am no judge, being imprisoned and unable to ascertain the truth. Hast thou
      understood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all that for three mohurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay. The price is now two mohurs again. It will be one unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three, sahib! It was three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then run! Hasten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shadows swallowed her again. She crept where they were darkest&mdash;lay
      still once, breathless, while a man walked almost over her&mdash;reached
      the outer wall, and felt her way along it until she reached low eaves that
      reached down like a jagged saw from utter blackness. Less than a minute
      later she was crawling monkeywise along a roof; before another five had
      passed she had dropped on all fours in the dust of the outer road and was
      running like a black ghost&mdash;head down&mdash;an end of her loin-cloth
      between her teeth&mdash;one arm held tight to her side and the other
      crooked outward, swinging&mdash;striding, panting, boring through the
      blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wasted little time at the caravansary. The gate was shut and a sleepy
      watchman cursed her for breaking into his revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horses? Belonging to a Rangar? Fool! Does not the Maharajah-sahib impound
      all horses left ownerless? Ask them back of him that took them! Go,
      night-owl! Go ask him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost as quickly as a native pony could have eaten up the distance, she
      dropped panting on the door-step of the little mission house. She was
      panting now from fright as well as sheer exhaustion. There were watchers&mdash;two
      sets of them. One man stood, with his back turned within ten paces of her,
      and another&mdash;less than two yards away from him&mdash;stood, turned
      half sideways, looking up the street and whistling to himself. There was
      not a corner or an angle of the little place that was not guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had tried the back door first, but that was locked, and she had rapped
      on it gently until she remembered that of evenings the missionary and his
      daughter occupied the front room always and that they would not have heard
      her had she hammered. She tapped now, very gently, with her fingers on the
      lower panel of the door, quaking and trembling in every limb, but taking
      care to make her little noise unevenly, in a way that would be certain to
      attract attention inside. Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap. Pause.
      Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap. The door opened suddenly. Both
      watchers turned and gazed straight into the lamplight that streamed out
      past the tall form of Duncan McClean. He stared at them and they stared
      back again. Joanna slunk into the deep shadow at one side of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary for you to annoy me by rapping on my door as well as by
      spying on me?&rdquo; asked the missionary in a tone of weary remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guards laughed and turned their backs with added insolence. In that
      second Joanna shot like a black spirit of the night straight past the
      missionary's legs and collapsed in a bundle on the floor behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door, sahib!&rdquo; she hissed at him. &ldquo;Quick! Shut the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut it and bolted it, half recognizing something in the voice or else
      guided by instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joanna!&rdquo; he exclaimed, holding up a lamp above her. &ldquo;You, Joanna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name, Rosemary McClean came running out&mdash;looked for an instant&mdash;and
      then knelt by the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, bring some water, please, quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary went in search of a water-jar, and Rosemary McClean bent
      down above the ancient, shrivelled, sorry-looking mummy of a woman&mdash;drew
      the wrinkled head into her lap&mdash;stroked the drawn face&mdash;and wept
      over her. The spent, age-weakened, dried-out widow had fainted; there was
      no wakened self-consciousness of black and white to interfere. This was a
      friend&mdash;one lone friend of her own sex amid all the waste of
      smouldering hate&mdash;some one surely to be wept over and made much of
      and caressed. The poor old hag recovered consciousness with her head
      pillowed on a European lap, and Duncan McClean&mdash;no stickler for
      convention and no believer in a line too tightly drawn&mdash;saw fit to
      remonstrate as he laid the jar of water down beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she answered, looking up at him, &ldquo;father, I'd have kissed a dog
      that got lost and came back again like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They picked her up between them, after they had let her drink, and carried
      her between them to the long, low sitting-room, where she told them&mdash;after
      considerable make-believe of being more spent than she really was&mdash;after
      about a tenth &ldquo;sip&rdquo; at the brandy flask and when another had been
      laughingly refused&mdash;all about Ali Partab and what his orders to her
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it all can mean?&rdquo; McClean sat back and tried to summarize
      his experiences of months and fit them into what Joanna said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked his daughter, leaning forward. She was
      staring at Joanna's forearm and from that to a dull-red patch on the
      woman's loin-cloth. Joanna answered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wounded, Joanna? Are you sure? That's blood! Look here, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He agreed that it was blood. It was dry and it came off her forearm in
      little flakes when he rubbed it. But not a word could they coax out of
      Joanna to explain it, until Rosemary&mdash;drawing the old woman to her&mdash;espied
      the handle of her knife projecting by an inch above the waist-fold of her
      cloth. Too late Joanna tried to hide it. Rosemary held her and drew it
      out. Beyond any shadow of a doubt, there was blood on the blade still, and
      on the wooden hilt, and caked in the clumsy joint between the hilt and
      blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Joanna&mdash;have you killed any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joanna shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the truth, Joanna. Whose blood is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dog's, Miss-sahib. A street dog attacked me as I ran hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too!&rdquo; said her father, and he took Joanna to one side and
      cross-examined her. But he could get no admission from her&mdash;nothing
      but the same statement, with added details each time he made her tell it,
      that she had killed a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fed her, and she ate like a hyena. No caste prejudices or forbidden
      foods troubled her; she ate whatever came her way, Hindoo food, or
      Mohammedan, or Christian,&mdash;and reached for more&mdash;and finished,
      as hyenas finish, by breaking bones to get the marrow out. At midnight
      they left her, curled dogwise on a mat in the hall, to sleep; and at dawn,
      when they came to wake her, she was gone again&mdash;gone utterly, without
      a trace or sign of explanation. The doors, both front and back, were
      locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two days later when they found a hole torn through the thatch,
      through which she had escaped; and though they searched the house from
      cellar up to roof, and turned all their small possessions over, they could
      not find (and they were utterly glad of it) that she had stolen anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; said the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've finished disbelieving in Joanna!&rdquo; said his daughter with a grimace
      that went always with irrevocable decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to the conclusion,&rdquo; said McClean, &ldquo;that there are more than
      just Joanna to be trusted. There is Ali Partab, and&mdash;who knows how
      many?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Against all fear; against the weight of what,
    For lack of worse name, men miscall the Law;
    Against the Tyranny of Creed; against the hot,
    Foul Greed of Priest, and Superstition's Maw;
    Against all man-made Shackles, and a man-made Hell&mdash;
    Alone&mdash;At last&mdash;Unaided&mdash;
            I REBEL!
</pre>
    <p>
      No single, individual circumstance, but a chain of happenings in very
      quick succession, brought about a climax, forcing the hand of Howrah and
      his brother and for the moment drawing the McCleans, father and daughter,
      into the toothed wheel of Indian action. As usual in India, the usual
      brought about the unexpected, and the unexpected fitted strangely into the
      complex, mysteriously worked-out whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after Joanna left the mission house, through a hole made in the
      thatch, the spirit of revolt took hold of Rosemary McClean again. The
      stuffy, narrow quarters&mdash;the insolent, doubled, unexplained, but very
      obvious, guard that lounged outside&mdash;the sense of rank injustice and
      helplessness&mdash;the weird feeling of impending horror added onto
      stale-grown ghastliness&mdash;youth, chafing at the lack of liberty&mdash;stirred
      her to action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word to her father, who was writing reports that seemed endless
      at the little desk by the shaded window, she left the house&mdash;drew
      with a physical effort on all her reserve of strength and health&mdash;faced
      the scorching afternoon wind, as though it were a foe that could shrink
      away before her courage, and walked, since she had no pony now, in any
      direction in which chance or her momentary whim might care to lead her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't cry again&mdash;and I won't submit&mdash;and I'll see what
      happens!&rdquo; she told herself; and the four who followed her at a
      none-too-respectful distance&mdash;two of the Maharajah's men in uniform
      and two shabby-looking ruffians of Jaimihr's&mdash;grinned as they scented
      action. Like their masters they bore no love for one another; they were
      there now, in fact, as much to watch one another as the missionaries; they
      detected the possibility of an excuse to be at one another's throats, and
      gloated as they saw two messengers, one of either side, run off in a hurry
      to inform the rival camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was neither plan nor conscious selection that led Rosemary McClean
      toward the far end of the maidan, where the sluggish, narrow, winding
      Howrah River sucked slimily beside the burning ghats. When she realized
      where her footsteps were leading her she would have turned in horror and
      retreated, for even a legitimately roasting corpse that died before the
      Hindoo priests had opportunity to introduce it to the flames is no sight
      for eyes that are civilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when she turned her head, the sight of her hurrying escort perspiring
      in her wake&mdash;(few natives like the heat and wind one whit better than
      their conquerors)&mdash;filled her with an unexpected, probably
      unjustifiable, determination not to let them see her flinch at any kind of
      horror. That was the spirit of sahibdom that is not always quite
      commendable; it is the spirit that takes Anglo-Saxon women to the
      seething, stenching plains and holds them there high-chinned to stiffen
      their men-folk by courageous example, but it leads, too, to things not
      quite so womanly and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show them!&rdquo; muttered Rosemary McClean, wiping the blown dust from
      her eyes and facing the wind again that now began to carry with it the
      unspread taint&mdash;the awful, sickening, soul-revolting smell
      inseparable from Hindoo funeral rites. There were three pyres,
      low-smouldering, close by the river-bank, and men stirred with long poles
      among the ashes to make sure that the incineration started the evening
      before should be complete; there was one pyre that looked as though it had
      been lit long after dawn&mdash;another newly lit&mdash;and there were two
      pyres building.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was those two new ones that held her attention, and finally decided her
      to hold her course. She wanted to make sure. The smell of burning&mdash;the
      unoutlined, only guessed-at ghastliness&mdash;would probably have killed
      her courage yet, before she came close enough to really see; but the
      suspicion of a greater horror drew her on, as snakes are said to draw
      birds on, by merely being snakes, and with red-rimmed eyes smarting from
      smoke as well as wind she pressed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghats were deserted-looking, for the funeral rites of those who burned
      were practically over until the time should come to scatter ashes on the
      river-surface; only a few attendants hovered close to the fires to prod
      them and occasionally throw on extra logs. Only round the two new pyres
      not yet quite finished was anything approaching a crowd assembled, and
      there a priest was officiously directing the laying of the logs. It was
      the manner of their laying and the careful building of a scaffold on each
      side of either pyre that held Rosemary McClean's attention&mdash;called
      all the rebellious womanhood within her to interfere&mdash;and drew her
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the priest noticed her&mdash;a cotton-skirted wraith amid the smoke&mdash;and
      shouted to the guards behind; one of them answered, laughing coarsely, and
      Rosemary understood enough of the dialect he used to grit her teeth with
      shame and anger. The men left off building, and, directed by the priest,
      came toward her in a ragged line to cut her off from closer approach; she
      stood, then&mdash;examined the new pyres as carefully as she could&mdash;walked
      to another vantage-point and viewed them sideways&mdash;then turned her
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the brutes!&rdquo; she ejaculated. There were tears in her voice, as well
      as helpless anger. &ldquo;There is not one devil, there are a million, and they
      all live here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked back again once, trembling with an overmastering hate, directed
      less at the priest who grinned back at her than at the loathsome rite he
      represented. In two actual words, she cursed him. It was the first time
      she had ever cursed anybody in her life, and the wickedness of doing it
      swept over her as a relief. She revelled in it. She was glad she had
      cursed him. Her little, light, graceful body that had been quivering grew
      calm again, and she turned to hurry home with an unexpected sense of
      having pulled some lever in the mechanism that would bring about results.
      She neither knew nor cared what results, nor how they were to happen; she
      felt that that curse of hers, her first, had landed on the mark!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had come further than she thought. Distance, hot wind, and emotion
      had exhausted her far more, too, than she had had time to realize. Before
      a mile of the homeward journey had been accomplished, she was forced
      against her stubborn Scots will to sit down on a big stone by the roadside
      and rest, while the four that followed came up close, grinning and passing
      remarks in anything but under-tones. If the meaning of the words escaped
      her, their gestures left little to be misunderstood. A crowd of stragglers
      drew together near the four&mdash;laughed with them&mdash;took sides in
      the coarse-worded argument about Jaimihr's known ambition&mdash;and shamed
      her into pressing on homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was forced to rest again, and then again. Physical sickness
      prevented her from obeying instinct, reason, will, that all three urged
      her on. No false pride now told her to dare the insolence of the guards;
      nothing appealed to her but the desire to hurry, hurry, hurry, and do
      whatever should appear to need doing when she reached the mission house.
      She had no plan in her head. She only knew that she had cursed a man, and
      that the curse was potent. But her feet dragged, and her vitality died
      down. It was sundown when she reached the mission house, and she could
      hear the rising, falling, intermittent din of drums before she saw her
      father in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; She ran to him, and he caught her in his arms to save her from
      falling headlong. &ldquo;Father, there is going to be a suttee tonight! Hear the
      drums, father! Hear the drums! It'll be tonight! That's to stop the
      screams from being heard! Listen to them, father&mdash;two suttees, side
      by side&mdash;I've seen the pyres and the scaffolds&mdash;do they jump
      into the flames, father, from the scaffolds?&mdash;tell me! No-don't tell
      me&mdash;I won't listen! Take me away from here&mdash;away&mdash;away&mdash;away&mdash;take
      me away, d'you hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carried her inside, and laid her on the caned couch in the living-room,
      looking like a great, big, helpless, gray-haired baby, as any man is prone
      to do when he has hysteria to deal with in a woman whom he loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cursed a man, father! I cursed a man! I did! I said 'Damn you!' I'm
      glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, little girl&mdash;don't! Lassie mine, don't! Never mind what you
      saw or what you said&mdash;be calm now&mdash;there is something we must
      do; we must act; I have determined we must act. We must act tonight. But
      we can't do anything with you in this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, gradually he calmed her&mdash;or probably she grew calm, in spite
      of his attentions, for he was too upset himself to exercise much soothing
      sway over anybody else. At last, though, she fell into a fitful sleep, and
      he sat beside her, holding rigid the left hand that she clutched, letting
      it stiffen and grow cold and numb for fear of waking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside a full moon rose majestically, pure and silvery as peace herself,
      bathing the universe in blessings. And each month, when the full moon rose
      above the carved dome of Siva's temple, there was a ceremony gone through
      that commemorated cruelty, greed, poisoning, throat-slitting, hate, and
      all the hell-invented infamy that suckles always at the breast of stagnant
      treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since history has forgotten when, at each full moon, the priests of Siva
      had gone with circumstantial ceremony to view the hoarded wealth tied up
      by jealousy and guarded jealously in Howrah's palace. With them, as the
      custom that was stronger than a thousand laws dictated, went the Maharajah
      and his brother Jaimihr&mdash;joint owners with the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had not been one Maharajah, since the first of that long line, who
      would not have given the lives of ten thousand men for leave to broach
      that treasure; nor, since the first heir apparent shared the secret with
      the priests and the holder of the throne, had there been one prince in
      line-son-brother-cousin&mdash;who would not have drenched the throne with
      his relation's blood with that same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heir after heir could have agreed with Maharajah, but the priests had
      stood between. That treasure was their fulcrum; the legacy, dictated by a
      dead, misguided hand, intended as a war reserve to stay the throne of
      Howrah in its need, and trebly locked to guard against profligacy, had
      placed the priests of Siva in the position of dictators of Howrah's
      destiny. A word from them, and a prince would slay his father&mdash;only
      to discover that the promises of Siva's priests were something less to
      build on than the hope of loot. There would be another heir apparent to be
      let into the secret&mdash;another man to scheme and hunger for the throne&mdash;another
      party to the bloody three-angled intrigue which kept the Siva-servers fat
      and the princes lean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past masters of the art by which superstitious ignorance is swayed, the
      priests could swing the allegiance of the mob whichever way they chose&mdash;even
      the soldiers, loyal enough to their masters under ordinary circumstances,
      would have rebelled at as much as a hint from holy Siva. It was the
      priests who made it possible for Jaimihr to dare take his part in the
      ceremony; without them he would not have entered his brother's palace-yard
      unless five thousand men at least were there to guard his back&mdash;but,
      if there was danger where the priests were, there was safety too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the custom was, he rode to the temple of Siva first with a ten-man
      guard; there, when the priests had finished droning age-old anthems to the
      echoing roof, when his brother, the Maharajah, also with a ten-man guard,
      had joined him, and the two had submitted to the sanctifying rites
      prescribed, eleven priests would walk with them in solemn mummery to the
      palace-entrance&mdash;censer-swinging, chanting, blasphemously acting duty
      to their gods and state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon&mdash;and that, too, was custom-rested with her lower rim one
      full hand's breadth above the temple dome as viewed from the palace-gate,
      when a gong clanged resonantly, died to silence, music of pipes and
      cymbals broke on the evening quiet, and the strange procession started
      from the temple door, the Maharajah leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally it passed uninterrupted over the intervening street to the
      palace-entrance, between the ranks of a salaaming, silent crowd, and
      disappeared from view. This time, though, for the first time in living
      memory, and possibly for the first time in all history, the unforeseen,
      amazing happened. The procession stopped. Moon-bathed, between the carved
      posts of the palace-gate, two people blocked the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music ceased. The sudden silence framed itself against the distant
      thunder of a hundred drums. The crowd&mdash;all heads bowed, as decreed&mdash;drew
      in its breath and held it. A sea of pugrees moved as brown eyes looked up
      surreptitiously&mdash;stared&mdash;memorized&mdash;and then looked down
      again. There was no precedent for this happening, and even the Maharajah
      and the priests were at a momentary loss&mdash;stood waiting, staring&mdash;and
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maharajah-sahib!&mdash;I must interrupt your ceremony. I must have word
      with you at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Duncan McClean, bareheaded, holding his daughter's hand. They had
      no weapons; they were messengers of peace, protesting, or so they looked.
      No longer timid, but resigned to what might happen&mdash;they held each
      other's hands, and blocked the way of Siva's votaries&mdash;Siva's tools&mdash;and
      Siva's ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr whispered to his brother&mdash;the first time he had dared one
      word to him in person for years&mdash;the high priest of the temple
      pressed forward angrily, saying nothing, but trying to combine rage and
      dignity with an attempt to turn the incident to priestly advantage. Surely
      this was a crisis out of which the priests must come triumphant; they held
      all the cards&mdash;knew how and when rebellion was timed, and could
      compare, as the principals themselves could not do, Howrah's strength with
      Jaimihr's. And the priests had the crowd to back them&mdash;the ignorant,
      superstitious crowd that can make or dethrone emperors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some strange freak of real dignity&mdash;curiosity perhaps, or
      possibly occasion&mdash;spurred desire to act of his own initiative and
      keep the high priest in his place&mdash;impelled the Maharajah in that
      minute. Men said afterward that Jaimihr had whispered to him advice which
      he knew was barbed because it was his brother whispering, and that he
      promptly did the opposite; but, whatever the motive, he drew himself up in
      all his jewelled splendor and demanded: &ldquo;What do you people wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The McCleans were given no time to reply. The priests did not see fit to
      let the reins of this occasion slip; the word went out, panic-voiced, that
      sacrilege to Siva was afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slay them! Slay them!&rdquo; yelled the crowd. &ldquo;They violate the sacred rites!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were no Mohammedans among that crowd to take delight in seeing
      Hindoo priests discomfited and Hindoo ritual disturbed. There came no
      counter-shout. The crowd did not, as so often happens, turn and rend
      itself; and yet, though a surge from behind pressed forward, the men in
      front pressed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slay them! Slay the sacrilegious foreigners!&rdquo; The yell grew louder and
      more widely voiced, but no man in the front ranks moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Maharajah looked from the company of guards that lined the
      palace-steps to the priests and his brother and the crowd&mdash;and then
      to the McCleans again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered Alwa and his Rangars, thought of the messenger whom he had
      sent, remembered that a regiment of lance-armed horsemen would be worth a
      risk or two to win over to his side, and made decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in danger,&rdquo; he asserted, using a pronoun not intended to convey
      politeness, but&mdash;Eastern of the East&mdash;counteracting that by
      courtesy of manner. &ldquo;Do you ask my aid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, among other things,&rdquo; Duncan McClean answered him. &ldquo;I wish also to
      speak about a Rangar, who I know is held prisoner in a cage in the
      Jaimihr-sahib's palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak of that later,&rdquo; answered Howrah. &ldquo;Guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign. A spoken word might have told the priests too much, and
      have set them busy fore-stalling him. The guards rushed down the steps,
      seized both McCleans, and half-carried, half-hustled them up the
      palace-steps, through the great carved doors, and presently returned
      without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are my prisoners,&rdquo; said the Maharajah, turning to the high priest.
      &ldquo;We will now proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was satisfied, at least for the time being. Well versed in the
      kind of treatment meted out to prisoners, partly informed of what was
      preparing for the British all through India, the crowd never doubted for
      an instant but that grizzly vengeance awaited the Christians who had dared
      to remonstrate against time-honored custom. It looked for the moment as
      though the high priest's word had moved the Maharajah to order the arrest,
      and the high priest realized it. By skilful play and well-used dignity he
      might contrive to snatch all the credit yet. He ordered; the pipes and
      cymbals started up again at once; and, one by one&mdash;Maharajah,
      Jaimihr, high priest, then royal guard, Jaimihr's guard, priest again&mdash;the
      procession wound ahead, jewelled and egretted, sabred and spurred,
      priest-robed, representative of all the many cancers eating at the heart
      of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chanting, clanging, wailing minor dirges to the night, it circled all the
      front projections of the palace, turned where a small door opened on a
      courtyard at one side, entered, and disappeared.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Oh, is it good, my soldier prince and is the wisdom clear,
    To guard thy front a thousand strong, while ten may take thy rear?
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, because it was impregnable to almost anything except a
      yet-to-be-invented air-ship, the Alwa-sahib owned a fortress still,
      high-perched on a crag that overlooked a glittering expanse of desert.
      More precious than its bulk in diamonds, a spring of clear, cold water
      from the rock-lined depths of mother earth gushed out through a fissure
      near the Summit, and round that spring had been built, in bygone
      centuries, a battlemented nest to breed and turn out warriors. Alwa's
      grandfather had come by it through complicated bargaining and
      dowry-contracts, and Alwa now held it as the rallying-point for the
      Rangars thereabout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But its defensibility was practically all the crag fort had to offer by
      way of attraction. Down at its foot, where the stream of rushing water
      splashed in a series of cascades to the thirsty, sandy earth, there were
      an acre or two of cultivation&mdash;sufficient, in time of peace, to
      support an attenuated garrison and its horses. But for his revenues the
      Alwa-sahib had to look many a long day's march afield. Leagues of desert
      lay between him and the nearest farm he owned, and since&mdash;more in the
      East than anywhere&mdash;a landlord's chief absorption is the watching of
      his rents, it followed that he spent the greater part of his existence in
      the saddle, riding from one widely scattered tenant to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was luck or fortuitous circumstance&mdash;Fate, he would have called
      it, had he wasted time to give it name&mdash;that brought him along a road
      where, many miles from Howrah City, he caught sight of Joanna. Needless to
      say, he took no slightest notice of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dog-weary, parched, sore-footed, she was hurrying along the burning, sandy
      trail that led in the direction of Alwa's fort. The trail was narrow, and
      the horsemen whose mounts ambled tirelessly behind Alwa's plain-bred Arab
      pressed on past him, to curse the hag and bid her make horse-room for her
      betters. She sunk on the sand and begged of them. Laughingly, they asked
      her what a coin would buy in all that arid waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the jackals, then, turned tradesman?&rdquo; they jeered; but she only
      mumbled, and displayed her swollen tongue, and held her hands in an
      attitude of pitiful supplication. Then Alwa cantered up&mdash;rode past&mdash;heard
      one of his men jeering&mdash;drew rein and wheeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her water!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and watched her while she knelt, face upward, and a Rangar poured
      lukewarm water from a bottle down her tortured throat. He held it high and
      let the water splash, for fear his dignity might suffer should he or the
      bottle touch her. Strictly speaking, Rangars have no caste, but they
      retain by instinct and tradition many of the Hindoo prejudices. Alwa
      himself saw nothing to object to in the man's precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the old crows' meat whither she was running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she would find the Alwa-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I am he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joanna fawned and laid her wrinkled forehead in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Thy service is dishonor and my ears are deaf to it!
      Now, speak! Hast thou a message? Who is it sends a rat to bring me news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ali Partab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soho! And who is Ali Partab? He needs to learn manners. He has come to a
      stern school for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib&mdash;great one&mdash;Prince of swordsmen!&mdash;Ali Partab is
      Mahommed Gunga-sahib's man. He bid me say that he is held a prisoner in a
      bear-cage in Jaimihr's palace and needs aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa's black beard dropped onto his chest as he frowned in thought. He had
      nine men with him. Jaimihr had by this time, perhaps, as many as nine
      thousand, for no one knew but Jaimihr and the priests how many in the
      district waited to espouse his cause. The odds seemed about as stupendous
      as any that a man of his word had ever been called upon to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more, and without consulting any one, he bade one of his men
      dismount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that hag on thy horse!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Mount thou behind another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order was obeyed. Another Rangar took the led horse, and Joanna found
      herself, perched like a monkey on a horse that objected to the change of
      riders, between two troopers whose iron-thewed legs squeezed hers into the
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Howrah City!&rdquo; ordered Alwa, starting off at an easy, desert-eating
      amble; and without a word of comment, but with downward glances at their
      swords and a little back-stiffening which was all of excitement that they
      deigned to show, his men wheeled three and three behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no affair of Alwa's that a full moon shone that night&mdash;none of
      his arranging that on that one night of the month Jaimihr and his most
      trusted body-guard should go with the priests and the Maharajah to inspect
      the treasure. Alwa was a soldier, born to take instant advantage of chance&mdash;sent
      opportunity; Jaimihr was a schemer, born to indecision and the cunning
      that seeks underhanded means but overlooks the obvious. Because the
      streets were full of men whose allegiance was doubtful yet, because he
      himself would be too occupied to sit like a spider in a web and watch the
      intentions of the crowd unfold, Jaimihr had turned out every retainer to
      his name, and had scattered them about the city, with orders, if they were
      needed, to rally on a certain point.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did think that at any minute a disturbance might break out which would
      lead to civil war, and he saw the necessity for watchfulness at every
      point; but he did not see the rather obvious necessity for leaving more
      than twenty men on guard inside his palace. Not even the thoughtfulness of
      Siva's priests could have anticipated that ten horse-men would be riding
      out of nowhere, with the spirit in them that ignores side issues and leads
      them only straight to their objective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa, as a soldier, knew exactly where fresh horses could be borrowed
      while his tired ones rested. A little way beyond the outskirts of the city
      lived a man who was neither Mohammedan nor Hindoo&mdash;a fearful man, who
      took no sides, but paid his taxes, carried on his business, and behaved&mdash;a
      Jew, who dealt in horses and in any other animal or thing that could be
      bought to show a profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa had an utterly complete contempt for Jews, as was right and proper in
      a Rangar of the blood. He had not met many of them, and those he had had
      borne away the memory of most outrageous insult gratuitously offered and
      rubbed home. But this particular Jew was a money-lender on occasion, and
      his rates had proved as reasonable as his acceptance of Alwa's unwritten
      promise had been prompt. A man who holds his given word as sacred as did
      Alwa respects, in the teeth of custom or religion, the man who accepts
      that word; so, when the chance had offered, Alwa had done the Jew
      occasional favors and had won his gratitude. He now counted on the Jew for
      fresh horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach him, he had to wade the Howrah River, less than a mile from where
      the burning ghats glowed dull crimson against the sky; the crowd around
      the ghats was the first intimation he received that the streets might
      prove less densely thronged than usual. It was the Jew, beard-scrabbling
      and fidgeting among his horses, who reminded him that when the full moon
      shone most of the populace, and most of Jaimihr's and Howrah's guards,
      would be occupied near Siva's temple and the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his own horses, groomed again, and gorging their fill of good,
      clean grain in the Jew's ramshackle stable place. Joanna he turned loose,
      to sneak into any rat-hole that she chose. Then, with their swords drawn&mdash;for
      if trouble came it would be certain to come suddenly&mdash;he and his nine
      made a wide-ringed circuit of the city, to a point where the main street
      passing Jaimihr's palace ended in a rune of wind-piled desert sand. From
      the moment when they reached that point they did not waste a second;
      action trod on the heel of thought and thought flashed fast as summer
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lit through the deserted street, troubling for speed, not silence;
      the few whom they passed had no time to determine who they were, and no
      one followed them. A few frightened night-wanderers ran at sight of them,
      hiding down side streets, but when they brought up at last outside
      Jaimihr's palace-gate they had so far escaped recognition. And that meant
      that no one would carry word to Jaimihr or his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was death-dark outside the bronze-hinged double gate; only a dim lamp
      hung above from chains, to show how dark it was, and the moon&mdash;cut
      off by trees and houses on a bluff of rising ground&mdash;lent nothing to
      the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open! The jaimihr-sahib comes!&rdquo; shouted Alwa and one of his horsemen
      legged up close beside the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one moved inside, for his footsteps could be heard; whoever he was
      appeared to listen cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open for the Jaimihr-sahib!&rdquo; repeated Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently that was not the usual command, or otherwise the gates would
      have swung open on the instant. Instead, one gate moved inward by a
      fraction of a foot, and a pureed head peered cautiously between the gap.
      That, though, was sufficient. With a laugh, the man up closest drove his
      sword-hilt straight between the Hindoo's eyes, driving his horse's
      shoulder up against the gate; three others spurred and shoved beside him.
      Not thirty seconds later Alwa and his nine were striking hoof sparks on
      the stone of Jaimihr's courtyard, and the gates&mdash;that could have
      easily withstood a hundred-man assault with battering-rams&mdash;had
      clanged behind them, bolted tight against their owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the bear cage?&rdquo; demanded Alwa. &ldquo;It is a bear I need, not blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dozen left inside to guard the palace had recovered quickly enough
      from their panic. They were lining up in the middle of the courtyard,
      ready to defend their honor, even if the palace should be lost. It was
      barely probable that Jaimihr's temper would permit them the privilege of
      dying quickly should he come and find his palace looted; a Rangar's sword
      seemed better, and they made ready to die hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Ali Partab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. The little crowd drew in, and one by one took up the
      fighting attitude that each man liked the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I did not come for blood! I came for Ali Partab! If I get him,
      unharmed, I ride away again; but otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What otherwise?&rdquo; asked the captain of the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This palace burns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary consultation&mdash;no argument, but a quickly
      reached agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is here, unharmed,&rdquo; declared the captain gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof have we that he is all you came for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My given word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Jaimihr-sahib&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You also have my given word that unless I get Ali Partab this palace
      burns, with all that there is in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Distrustful still, the captain of the guard called out to a sweeper,
      skulking in the shadow by the stables to go and loose Ali Partab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send no sweepers to him!&rdquo; ordered Alwa. &ldquo;He has suffered indignity
      enough. Go thou!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the guard obeyed. Two minutes later Ali Partab stood before
      Alwa and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, my master's thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are accepted,&rdquo; answered Alwa, with almost regal dignity. &ldquo;Bring a
      lamp!&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the guard brought a hand-lantern, and by its light Alwa examined
      Ali Partab closely. He was filthy, and his clothing reeked of the
      disgusting confinement he had endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this man clothing fit for a man of mine!&rdquo; commanded Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, there is none; perhaps the Jaimihr-sahib&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ordered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement among Alwa's men&mdash;a concerted,
      horse-length-forward movement, made terrifying by the darkness&mdash;each
      man knew well enough that the men they were bullying could fight; success,
      should they have to force it at the sword-point, would depend largely on
      which side took the other by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done, sahib,&rdquo; said the leader of the guard, and one man hurried off
      to execute the order. Ten minutes later&mdash;they were ten impatient
      minutes, during which the horses sensed the fever of anxiety and could be
      hardly made to stand&mdash;Ali Partab stood arrayed in clean, new khaki
      that fitted him reasonably well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sword, now!&rdquo; demanded Alwa. &ldquo;Thy sword! This man had a sword when he
      was taken! Give him thine, unless there is a better to be had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but obedience, for few things were more certain
      than that Alwa was not there to waste time asking for anything he would
      not fight for if refused. The guard held out his long sword, hilt first,
      and Ali Partab strapped it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had three horses when they took me,&rdquo; he asserted, &ldquo;three good ones,
      sound and swift, belonging to my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take three of Jaimihr's!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took ten minutes more for Ali Partab and two of Alwa's men to search
      the stables and bring out the three best chargers of the twenty and more
      reserved for Jaimihr's private use. They were wonders of horses, half-Arab
      and half-native-bred, clean-limbed and firm&mdash;worth more, each one of
      them, than all three of Mahommed Gunga's put together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they good enough?&rdquo; demanded Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master will be satisfied,&rdquo; grinned Ali Partab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the gate, then!&rdquo; Alwa was peering through the blackness for a sight
      of firearms, but could see none. He guessed&mdash;and he was right&mdash;that
      the guard had taken full advantage of their master's absence, and had been
      gambling in a corner while their rifles rested under cover somewhere else.
      For a second he hesitated, dallying with the notion of disarming the guard
      before he left, then decided that a fight was scarcely worth the risking
      now, and with ten good men behind him he wheeled and scooted through the
      wide-flung gates into outer gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He galloped none too fast, for his party was barely out of range before a
      ragged volley ripped from the palace-wall; one of his men, hampered and
      delayed by a led horse that was trying to break away from him, was
      actually hit, and begged Alwa to ride back and burn the palace after all.
      He was grumbling still about the honor of a Rangar, when Alwa called a
      halt in the shelter of a deserted side street in order to question Ali
      Partab further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali Partab protested that he did not know what to say or think about the
      missionaries. He explained his orders and vowed that his honor held him
      there in Howrah until Miss McClean should consent to come away. He did not
      mention the father; he was a mere side issue&mdash;it was Alwa who asked
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tick on the belly of an ox rides with the ox,&rdquo; said Ali Partab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead on, then, to the mission house,&rdquo; commanded Alwa, and the ten-man
      troop proceeded to obey. They had reached the main street again, and were
      wheeling into it, when Joanna sprang from gutter darkness and intercepted
      them. She was all but ridden down before Ali Partab recognized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mohurs, sahib!&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Three golden mohurs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, three!&rdquo; said Ali Partab, giving her a hand and yanking her off the
      ground. She sprang across his horse's rump behind him, and he seemed to
      have less compunction about personal defilement than the others had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she thy wife or thy mother-in-law?&rdquo; laughed Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib, but my creditor! The mother of confusion tells me that the
      Miss-sahib and her father are in Howrah's palace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They halted, all together in a cluster in the middle of the street&mdash;shut
      in by darkness&mdash;watched for all they knew, by a hundred enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of their own will or as prisoners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As prisoners, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the side street! Quickly! Jaimihr' rat's nest is one affair,&rdquo; he
      muttered; &ldquo;Howrah' beehive is another!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Now, secrets and things of the Councils of Kings
    Are deucid expensive to buy,
    For it wouldn't look nice if a Councillor's price
    Were anything other than high.
    Be advised, though, and note that the price they will quote
    Is less at each grade you go deeper,
    And&mdash;(Up on its toes it's the Underworld knows!)&mdash;
    The cheapest of all is the Sweeper.
</pre>
    <p>
      JOANNA&mdash;when Alwa forgot about her and loosed her to run just where
      she chose&mdash;had sneaked, down alleys and over roof-tops, straight for
      the mission house. She found there nothing but a desultory guard and an
      impression, rather than the traces, of an empty cage. About two minutes of
      cautious questioning of neighbors satisfied her where the missionaries
      were; nothing short of death seemed able to deprive her of ability to flit
      like a black bat through the shadows, and the distance to Howrah's palace
      was accomplished, by her usual bat's entry route, in less time than a pony
      would have taken by the devious street. Before Alwa had thundered on
      Jaimihr's gate Joanna had mingled in the crowd outside the palace and was
      shrewdly questioning again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived too late to see McClean and his daughter seized; what she did
      hear was that they were prisoners, and that the Maharajah, Jaimihr, and
      the priests were all of them engaged in the secret ceremony whose
      beginning was a monthly spectacle but whose subsequent developments&mdash;supposed
      to be somewhere in the bowels of the earth&mdash;were known only to the
      men who held the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a rat running in the wainscot holes, she tried to follow the
      procession; like everybody else, she knew the way it took from the palace
      gate, and&mdash;as few others were&mdash;she was aware of a scaling-place
      on the outer wall where a huge baobab drooped century-scarred branches
      nearly to the ground on either side. The sacred monkeys used that route
      and where they went Joanna could contrive to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was another member of the sweeper caste, lurking in the darkness of an
      inner courtyard, who pointed out the bronze-barred door to her through
      which the treasure guardians had chanted on their way; it was he, too, who
      told her that Rosemary McClean and her father had been rushed into the
      palace through the main entrance. Also, he informed her that there was no
      way&mdash;positively no way practicable even for a monkey or a bird&mdash;of
      following further. He was a sweeper-intimate acquaintance of creeper
      ladders, trap-doors, gutters drains, and byways; she realized at once that
      there would be no wisdom in attempting to find within an hour what he had
      not discovered in a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joanna, her beady eyes glittering between the wrinkled folds of skin,
      slunk deeper in a shadow and began to think. She, the looker-on, had seen
      the whole play from its first beginning and could judge at least that part
      of it which had its bearing on her missionary masters. First, she knew
      what Jaimihr's ambition was&mdash;every man in Howrah knew how he planned
      to seize Miss McClean when the moment should be propitious&mdash;and her
      Eastern wisdom warned her that Jaimihr, foiled, would stop at nothing to
      contrive vengeance. If he could not seize Miss McClean, he would be likely
      to use every means within his power to bring about her death and prevent
      another from making off with his prize. Jaimihr, then, was the most
      pressing danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, as a Hindoo, she knew well how fiendishly the priests loathed the
      Christian missionaries; and it was common knowledge that the Maharajah was
      cross-hobbled by the priests. The Maharajah was a fearful man, and, unless
      the priests and Jaimihr threatened him with a show of combination, there
      was a slight chance that he might dread British vengeance too much to dare
      permit violence to the McCleans. Possibly he might hold out against the
      priests alone; but before an open alliance between Jaimihr and the priests
      he would surrender for his own throne's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far Joanna could reason readily enough, for there was a vast fund of
      wisdom stored beneath her wrinkled ugliness. But her Eastern limitation
      stopped her there. She could not hold loyalty to more than one cause, or
      to more than one offshoot of that cause, in the same shrewd head at once.
      She decided that at all costs Jaimihr must be out of the way so that the
      Maharaja might be left to argue with the priests alone. For the moment no
      other thought occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The means seemed ready to her hand. A peculiarity of the East, which is
      democratic in most ways under the veneer of swaggering autocracy, that
      servants of the very lowest caste may speak, and argue on occasion, with
      men who would shudder at the prospect of defilement from their touch.
      There was nothing in the least outrageous in the proposition that the
      sweeper, waiting in a corner for the procession to emerge again so that he
      might curl on his mat and sleep undisturbed when it had gone, should dare
      to approach Jaimihr and address him. He would run no small risk of being
      beaten by the guards; but, on the other hand, should he catch jaimihr's
      ear and interest him, he would be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldst thou win Jaimihr's favor?&rdquo; asked Joanna, creeping up beside him,
      and whispering with all the suggestiveness she could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would not? Who knows that within week he will not be ruler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. I have a message for him. I must hurry back. Deliver it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the nature of the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This. His prisoner is gone. A raid has taken place. In his absence, while
      his men patrolled the city, certain Rangars broke into his palace&mdash;looted&mdash;and
      prepared to burn. Bid him hurry back with all the men he can collect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom is this message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the captain of the guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am to deliver it? Thou dodderest! Mother of a murrain, have I not
      trouble sufficient for one man? Who bears bad news to a prince, or to any
      but his enemy? I&mdash;with these two eyes&mdash;I saw what happened to
      the men who bore bad news to Howrah once. I&mdash;with this broom of mine&mdash;I
      helped clean up the mess. Deliver thine own message!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay. Afterward I will say this&mdash;to the Jaimihr-sahib in person.
      There is one, I will tell him, a sweeper in the palace, who refused to
      bear tidings when the need was great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his palace is burned and his wealth all ashes, who cares what Jaimihr
      hears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no glow yet in the sky,&rdquo; said Joanna looking up. &ldquo;The palace is
      not yet in flames; they loot still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if it be not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Jaimihr not be glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see me, the bearer of false news, impaled&mdash;or crushed
      beneath an elephant&mdash;ay&mdash;glad, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reward, were the Jaimihr-sahib warned in time, would be a great one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why waitest thou not to have word with him. Art thou above
      rewards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear! He will know in good time who it was brought thee the
      news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They argued for ten minutes, Joanna threatening and coaxing and promising
      rewards, until at last the man consented. It was the thought, thoroughly
      encouraged by Joanna, that the penalty for not speaking would be greater
      than the beating he might get for bearing evil news that at last convinced
      him; and it was not until she had won him over and assured herself that he
      would not fail that it dawned on Joanna just what an edged tool she was
      playing with. While getting rid of Jaimihr, she was endangering the
      liberty and life of Alwa&mdash;the one man able to do anything for the
      McCleans!
    </p>
    <p>
      That thought sent her scooting over housetops, diving down dark alleyways,
      racing, dodging, hiding, dashing on again, and brought her in the nick of
      time to a ditch, from whose shelter she sprang and seized the hand of Ali
      Partab. That incident, and her intimation that the missionaries were in
      Howrah's palace, took Alwa back up the black, blind side street; and
      before he emerged from it he saw Jaimihr and his ten go thundering past,
      their eyes on the sky-line for a hint of conflagration, and their horses&mdash;belly-to-the-earth&mdash;racing
      as only fear, or enthusiasm, or grim desperation in their riders' minds
      can make them race.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, in groups and scattered fours, and one by one, his
      heavy-breathing troopers followed, cursing the order that had sent them
      abroad with-out their horses, damning&mdash;as none but a dismounted
      cavalryman can damn&mdash;the earth's unevenness, their swords, their
      luck, their priests, the night, their boots, and Jaimihr. Forewarned, Alwa
      held on down the pitch-dark side street, into whose steep-sided chasm the
      moon's rays would not reach for an hour or two to come, and once again he
      led his party in a sweeping, wide-swung circle, loose-reined and swifter
      than the silent night wind&mdash;this time for Howrah's palace. There was
      his given word, plighted to Mahommed Gunga, to redeem.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Ha! my purse may be lean, but my 'scutcheon is clean,
    And I'm backed by a dozen true men;
    I've a sword to my name, and a wrist for the same;
    Can a king frown fear into me, then?
</pre>
    <p>
      IT is the privilege of emperors, and kings and princes, that&mdash;however
      little real authority they have, or however much their power is undermined
      by men behind the throne&mdash;they must be accorded dignity. They must
      be, on the face of things, obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspection of the treasure finished and an hour-long mummery of rites
      performed, the thirty wound their way, chanting, in single file back
      again. The bronze-enforced door, that was only first of half a hundred
      barriers between approach and the semi-sacred hoard, at last clanged shut
      and was locked with three locks, each of whose individual keys was in the
      keeping of a separate member of the three&mdash;Maharajah, Prince, and
      priest. The same keys fitted every door of the maze&mdash;made passages,
      but no one door would open without all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking like an omen from the deepest shadow, the sweeper called to
      Jaimihr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, thy palace burns! Sahib, thy prisoner runs! Haste, sahib! Call thy
      men and hasten back! Thy palace is in flames&mdash;the Rangars come to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a raven, disturbed into night omen-croaking, he sent forth his news
      from utter blackness into nerve-strung tension. No one member of the
      thirty but was on the alert for friction or sudden treachery; the were all
      eyes for each other, and the croaking fell on ears strained to the aching
      point. He had time to repeat his warning before one of Jaimihr's men
      stepped into the darkness where he hid and dragged him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, a woman came but now and brought the news. It was from the captain
      of the guard. The Rangars came to take their man away. They broke in. They
      burn. They loot. They&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jaimihr did not wait another instant to hear the rest. To him this
      seemed like the scheming of his brother. Now he imagined he could read
      between the lines! That letter sent to Alwa had been misreported to him,
      and had been really a call to come and free the prisoner and wreak Rangar
      vengeance! He understood! But first he must save his palace, if it could
      be saved. The priests must have deceived him, so he wasted no time in
      arguing with them; he ran, with his guards behind him, to the outer wall
      of Siva's temple where the horses waited, each with a saice squatting at
      his head. The saices were sent scattering among the crowd to give the
      alarm and send the rest of his contingent hurrying back; Jaimihr and his
      ten drove home their spurs, and streaked, as the frightened jackal runs
      when a tiger interrupts them at their worry, hell-bent-for-leather up the
      unlit street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Maharajah Howrah's custom-accorded dignity stood him in good stead.
      It flashed across his worried brain that space had been given him by the
      gods in which to think. Jaimihr&mdash;one facet of the problem and perhaps
      the sharpest&mdash;would have his hands full for a while, and the priests&mdash;wish
      how they would&mdash;would never dare omit the after-ritual in Siva's
      temple. He&mdash;untrammelled for an hour to come&mdash;might study out a
      course to take and hold with those embarrassing prisoners of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned&mdash;updrawn in regal stateliness&mdash;and intimated to the
      high priest that the ceremony might proceed without him. When the priests
      demurred and murmured, he informed them that he would be pleased to give
      them audience when the ritual was over, and without deigning another
      argument he turned through a side door into the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within ten minutes he was seated in his throne-room. One minute later his
      prisoners stood in front of him, still holding each other's hands, and the
      guard withdrew. The great doors opening on the marble outer hall clanged
      tight, and in this room there were no carved screens through which a
      hidden, rustling world might listen. There was gold-incrusted splendor&mdash;there
      were glittering, hanging ornaments that far outdid the peacocks' feathers
      of the canopy above the throne; but the walls were solid, and the marble
      floor rang hard and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no nook or corner anywhere that could conceal a man. For a
      minute, still bejewelled in his robes of state and glittering as the
      diamonds in his head-dress caught the light from half a dozen hanging
      lamps, the Maharajah sat and gazed at them, his chin resting on one hand
      and his silk-clad elbow laid on the carved gold arm of his throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I troubled?&rdquo; he demanded suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know!&rdquo; said the missionary. His daughter clutched his hand tightly,
      partly to reassure him, partly because she knew that a despot would be
      bearded now in his gold-bespattered den, and fear gripped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maharajah-sahib, when I came here with letters from the government of
      India and asked you for a mission house in which to live and work, I told
      you that I came as a friend&mdash;as a respectful sympathizer. I told you
      I would not incite rebellion against you, and that I would not interfere
      with native custom or your authority so long as acquiescence and obedience
      by me did not run counter to the overriding law of the British
      Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howrah did not even move his head in token that he listened, but his tired
      eyes answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that extent I promised not to interfere with your religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howrah nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once&mdash;twice&mdash;in all nine times&mdash;I came and warned you that
      the practice of suttee was and is illegal. My knowledge of Sanskrit is
      only slight, but there are others of my race who have had opportunity to
      translate the Sanskrit Vedas, and I have in writing what they found in
      them. I warned you, when that information reached me, that your priests
      have been deliberately lying to you&mdash;that the Vedas say:
      'Thrice-blessed is she who dies of a broken heart because her lord and
      master leaves her.' They say nothing, absolutely nothing, about suttee or
      its practice, which from the beginning has been a damnable invention of
      the priests. But the practice of suttee has continued. I have warned the
      government frequently, in writing, but for reasons which I do not profess
      to understand they have made no move as yet. For that reason, and for no
      other, I have tried to be a thorn in your side, and will continue to try
      to be until this suttee ceases!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; demanded Howrah, &ldquo;since you are a foreigner with neither influence
      nor right, do you stay here and behold what you cannot change? Does a
      snake lie sleeping on an ant-hill? Does a woman watch the butchering of
      lambs? Yet, do ant-hills cease to be, and are lambs not butchered? Look
      the other way! Sleep softer in another place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a prisoner. For months past my daughter and I have been prisoners to
      all intents and purposes, and you, Maharajah-sahib, have known it well.
      Now, the one man who was left to be our escort to another place is a
      prisoner, too. You know that, too. And you ask me why I stay! Suppose you
      answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary squeezed his hand again, this time less to restrain him than
      herself. She was torn between an inclination to laugh at the daring or
      shiver at the indiscretion of taking to task a man whose one word could
      place them at the mercy of the priests of Siva, or the mob. But Duncan
      McClean, a little bowed about the shoulders, peered through his spectacles
      and waited&mdash;quite unawed by all the splendor&mdash;for the
      Maharajah's answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what man do you speak?&rdquo; asked Howrah, still undecided what to do with
      them, and anxious above all things to disguise his thoughts. &ldquo;What man is
      a prisoner, and how do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before McClean had time to answer him, a spear haft rang on the great teak
      double door. There was a pause, and the clang repeated&mdash;another pause&mdash;a
      third reverberating, humming metal notice of an interruption, and the
      doors swung wide. A Hindoo, salaaming low so that the expression of his
      face could not be seen, called out down the long length of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alwa-sahib waits, demanding audience!&rdquo; There was no change apparent
      on Howrah's face. His fingers tightened on the jewelled cimeter that
      protruded, silk-sashed, from his middle, but neither voice nor eyes nor
      lips betrayed the least emotion. It was the McCleans whose eyes blazed
      with a new-born hope, that was destined to be dashed a second later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he guards with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ten, Maharajah-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then remove these people to the place where they were, and afterward
      admit him&mdash;without his guards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand permission to speak with this Alwa-sahib!&rdquo; said McClean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two spear-armed custodians of the door advanced. Resistance was obviously
      futile. Still holding his daughter's hand, the missionary let himself be
      led to the outer hall and down a corridor, where, presently, a six-inch
      door shut prisoners and guards even from sound of what transpired beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa, swaggering until his long spurs jingled like a bunch of keys each
      time his boot-heels struck the marble floor, strode straight as a soldier
      up to the raised throne dais&mdash;took no notice whatever of the sudden
      slamming of the door behind him&mdash;looked knife-keenly into Howrah's
      eyes&mdash;and saluted with a flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from bursting open Jaimihr's buzzard roost!&rdquo; he intimated mildly.
      &ldquo;He held a man of mine. I have the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merely to speak first was insolence; but that breach of etiquette was
      nothing to his manner and his voice. It appeared that he was so utterly
      confident of his own prowess that he could afford to speak casually; he
      did not raise his voice or emphasize a word. He was a man of his word,
      relating facts, and every line of his steel-thewed anatomy showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent a letter to you, by horseman, with a present,&rdquo; said Howrah. &ldquo;I
      await the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa's eyes changed, and his attention stiffened. Not having been at home,
      he knew nothing of the letter, but he did not choose to acknowledge the
      fact. The principle that one only shares the truth with friends is good,
      when taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I preferred to have confirmation of the matter from the Maharajah's lips
      in person, so&mdash;since I had this other matter to attend to&mdash;I
      combined two visits in one trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lied, as he walked and fought, like a soldier, and the weary man who
      watched him from the throne detected no false ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I informed you that I had extended my protection to the two missionaries,
      man and daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. Also, you did well.&rdquo; He tossed that piece of comfort to the
      despot as a man might throw table scraps to a starveling dog! &ldquo;I have come
      to take away the missionaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a guard of ten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first admission of astonishment that either man had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not aware that Jaimihr, too, has eyes on the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of it. I have shown Jaimihr how deep my fear of him lies! I
      know, too, how deep the love lies between thee and thy brother, king of
      Howrah! I am here to remind you that many more than ten men would race
      their horses to a stand-still to answer my summons&mdash;brave men,
      Maharajah-sahib&mdash;men whose blades are keen, and straightly held, and
      true. They who would rally round me against Jaimihr would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would fight for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet said so.&rdquo; There was a little, barely accentuated emphasis
      on the one word &ldquo;yet.&rdquo; The Maharajah thought a minute before he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many mounted troopers could you raise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? A thousand&mdash;three thousand&mdash;according to the
      soreness of the need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard&mdash;I know that you have heard&mdash;what, even at this
      minute, awaits the British? I know, for I have taken care to know, that a
      cousin of yours&mdash;Mahommed Gunga&mdash;is interested for the British.
      So&mdash;so I am interested to have word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa laughed ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tiger asked the wolf pack where good hunting was!&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;I
      and my men strike which way suits us when the hour comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My palace has many chambers in it!&rdquo; hinted Howrah. &ldquo;There have been men
      who wondered what the light of day was like, having long ago forgotten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me prisoner!&rdquo; laughed Alwa. &ldquo;Count then the hours until three
      thousand blades join Jaimihr and help him grease the dungeon hinges with
      thy fat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having looted Jaimihr's palace, you speak thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having whipped a dog, I wait for the dog to lick my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your purpose with these missionaries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To redeem my given word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be free to pledge it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom I choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to fight on my side
      when the hour comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The British.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no quarrel with the British, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give thee the missionaries, against thy word to support me on this
      throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against all comers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I refuse, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr&mdash;who by this time must surely be thy very warmest friend!&mdash;shall
      attack thee unmolested. Pledge thy word&mdash;take thy missionary people&mdash;and
      Jaimihr must oppose thee and me combined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should Jaimihr ride after me, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he takes many with him, he must leave his camp unguarded, or only
      weakly guarded. Then I would act. If he goes with few, how can he take thy
      castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have your protection against Jaimihr, and the missionaries,
      against my promise to support you on the throne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howrah rose, stepped forward to the dais edge, and held his hand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; swore Alwa, recoiling. &ldquo;My word is given. I take no Hindoo's hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howrah glared for a moment, but thought better of the hot retort that rose
      to his lips. Instead he struck a silver gong, and when the doors swung
      open ordered the prisoners to be produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape through the palace-grounds,&rdquo; he advised Alwa. &ldquo;A man of mine will
      show the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; said Alwa across his shoulder with more than royal insolence,
      &ldquo;I swore to help thee against Jaimihr and to support thee on thy throne&mdash;but
      in nothing did I swear to be thy tool&mdash;remember!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Howrah City bows the knee
    (More or less) to masters three,
    King, and Prince, and Siva.
    Howrah City comes and goes&mdash;
    Buys and sells&mdash;and never knows
    Which is friend, and which are foes&mdash;
            King, or Prince, or Siva.
</pre>
    <p>
      THAT that followed Alwa's breakaway was all but the tensest hour in Howrah
      City's history. The inevitable&mdash;the foiled rage of the priests and
      Jaimihr's impudent insistence that the missionaries should be handed over
      to him&mdash;the Maharajah's answer&mdash;all combined to set the
      murmurings afoot. Men said that the threatened rebellion against the rule
      of Britain had broken loose at last, and a dozen other quite as false and
      equally probable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr, finding that his palace was intact, and that only the prisoner
      and three horses from his stable were missing, placed the whole guard
      under arrest&mdash;stormed futilely, while his hurrying swarm flocked to
      him through the dinning streets&mdash;and then, mad-angry and made
      reckless by his rage, rode with a hundred at his back to Howrah's palace,
      scattering the bee-swarm of inquisitive but so far peaceful citizens right
      and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      With little ceremony, he sent in word to Howrah that he wanted Alwa and
      the missionaries; he stated that his private honor was at stake, and that
      he would stop at nothing to wreak vengeance. He wanted the man who had
      dared invade his palace&mdash;the man whom he had released&mdash;and the
      two who were the prime cause of the outrage. And with just as little
      ceremony word came out that the Maharajah would please himself as to what
      he did with prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      That message was followed almost instantly by the high priest of Siva in
      person, angry as a turkey-gobbler and blasphemously vindictive. He it was
      who told Jaimihr of the unexpected departure through the palace-grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride, Jaimihr-sahib! Ride!&rdquo; he advised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many have you? A hundred? Plenty! Ride and cut him off! There is but
      one road to Alwa's place; he must pass by the northern ford through Howrah
      River. Ride and cut him off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, loose-reined, foam-flecked, breathing vengeance, Jaimihr and his
      hundred thundered through the dark hot night, making a bee-line for the
      point where Alwa's band must pass in order to take the shortest route to
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his word to the Jew that saved Alwa's neck. He and his men were
      riding borrowed horses, and he had promised to return them and reclaim his
      own. They had moved at a walk through winding, dark palace-alleys, led by
      a palace attendant, and debouched through a narrow door that gave barely
      horse-room into the road where Jaimihr had once killed a Maharati trader
      who molested Rosemary McClean. The missionary and his daughter were
      mounted on the horses seized in Jaimihr's stable; Joanna, moaning about
      &ldquo;three gold mohurs, sahib&mdash;three, where are they?&rdquo; was up behind Ali
      Partab, tossed like a pea on a drum-skin by the lunging movements of the
      wonder of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of heading straight for home, in which case&mdash;although he did
      not know it&mdash;he would have been surely overhauled and brought to bay,
      he led at a stiff hand gallop to the Jew's, changed horses, crossed the
      ford by the burning ghats, and swooped in a wide half-circle for the sandy
      trail that would take him homeward. He made the home road miles beyond the
      point where Jaimihr waited for him&mdash;drew rein into the long-striding
      amble that desert-taught horses love&mdash;and led on, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Ho-ho! Here, then, is the end of Mahommed Gunga's
      scheming! Now, when he comes with arguments to make me fight on the
      British side, what a tale I have for him! Ho! What a swearing there will
      be! I will give him his missionary people, and say, 'There, Mahommed
      Gunga, cousin mine, there is my word redeemed&mdash;there is thy man into
      the bargain&mdash;there are three horses for thee&mdash;and I&mdash;I am
      at Howrah's beck and call!' Allah! What a swearing there will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was swearing, viler and more blasphemous than any of which Mahommed
      Gunga might be capable, where Jaimihr waited in the dark. He waited until
      the yellow dawn broke up the first dim streaks of violet before he
      realized that Alwa had given him the slip; and he cursed even the high
      priest of Siva when that worthy accosted him and asked what tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another trick!&rdquo; swore Jaimihr. &ldquo;So, thou and thy temple rats saw fit to
      send me packing for the night! What devils' tricks have been hatched out
      in my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The high priest started to protest, but Jaimihr silenced him with
      coarse-mouthed threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, can play double when occasion calls for it!&rdquo; he swore. And with
      that hint at coming trouble he clattered on home to his palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, when he reached home, he had the guard beaten all but
      unconscious for having dared let raiders in during the night before; then
      he sent them, waterless and thirsty, back to the dungeon. He felt better
      then, and called for ink and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he thought and wrote alternately, tearing up letter after
      letter. Then, at last, he read over a composition that satisfied him and
      set his seal at the foot. He placed the whole in a silver tube, poured wax
      into the joint, and called for the fat man who had been responsible for
      Ali Partab's capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Interfering fool! All this was thy doing! Didst thou
      see the guard beaten awhile ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. It was a lordly beating. The men are all but dead but will live
      for such another one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldst thou be so beaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I prevent, if your highness wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this. It is intended for Peshawur but may be given to any British
      officer above the rank of major. It calls for a receipt. Do not dare come
      back, or be caught in Howrah City, without a receipt for that tube and its
      contents intact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Alwa and Mahommed Gunga are in league with my brother,&rdquo; muttered
      Jaimihr to himself when the fat Hindoo had gone, &ldquo;then the sooner the
      British quarrel with both of them the better. Howrah alone I can dispose
      of easily enough, and there is yet time before rebellion starts for the
      British to spike the guns of the other two. By the time that is done, I
      will be Maharajah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was less than three days later when the word came mysteriously through
      the undiscoverable &ldquo;underground&rdquo; route of India for all men to be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the next full moon,&rdquo; went the message, from the priests alone knew
      where, &ldquo;all India will be waiting. When the full moon rises then the hour
      is come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when that full moon rises,&rdquo; thought Jaimihr to himself, &ldquo;my brother's
      funeral rites will be past history!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the present, though, he made believe to regret his recent rage, and
      was courteous to priest and Maharajah alike&mdash;even sending to his
      brother to apologize.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    They've called thee by an evil word,
            They've named thee traitor, friend o' mine.
    Thou askest faith?  I send my sword.
            There is no greater, friend o' mine.
</pre>
    <p>
      RALPH CUNNINGHAM said good-by to Brigadier-General Byng (Byng the
      Brigadier) with more feeling of regret and disappointment than he cared to
      show. A born soldier, he did his hard-mouthed utmost to refrain from
      whining; he even pretended that a political appointment was a recognizable
      advance along the road to sure success&mdash;or, rather, pretended that he
      thought it was; and the Brigadier, who knew men, and particularly young
      men, detected instantly the telltale expression of the honest gray eyes&mdash;analyzed
      it&mdash;and, to Cunningham's amazement, approved the unwilling
      make-believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, buck up, Cunningham!&rdquo; he said, slapping him familiarly on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;You're making a good, game effort to hide chagrin, and you're a
      good, game ass for your pains. There isn't one man in all India who has
      half your luck at this minute, if you only knew it; but go ahead and find
      out for yourself! Go to Abu and report, but waste no more time there than
      you can help. Hurry on to Howrah, and once you're there, if Mahommed Gunga
      tells you what looks like a lie, trust him to the hilt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he coming with me, then?&rdquo; asked Cunningham in some amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;unofficially. He has relations in that neighborhood and wants
      to visit them; he is going to take advantage of your pack-train and
      escort. You'll have a small escort as far as Abu; after that you'll be
      expected to look out for yourself. The escort is made up of details
      travelling down-country; they'll leave you at Abu Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, still unbelieving&mdash;still wondering why the Brigadier should go to
      all that trouble to convince him that politics in a half-forgotten native
      state were fair meat for a soldier&mdash;Cunningham rode off at the head
      of a variously made-up travelling party, grudging every step of that
      wonderful mare Mahommed Gunga had given him, that bore him away from the
      breeze-swept north&mdash;away from the mist-draped hills he had already
      learned to love&mdash;ever down, down, down into the hell-baked plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each rest-house where he spent a night was but another brooding-place of
      discontent and regret, each little petty detail connected with the command
      of the motley party (mainly time-expired men, homeward bound), was
      drudgery; each Hindoo pugree that he met was but a beastly contrast, or so
      it seemed to him, to the turbans of the troop that but a week ago had
      thundered at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than any other thing, Mahommed Gunga's cheerfulness amazed him. He
      resented it. He did not see why the man who had expressed such interest in
      the good fortune of his father's son should not be sympathetic now that
      his soldier career had been nipped so early in the bud. He began to lose
      faith in Mahommed Gunga's wisdom, and was glad when the ex-Risaldar chose
      to bring up the rear of the procession instead of riding by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behind, in Peshawur, there was one man at least who knew Mahommed
      Gunga and his worth, and who refused to let himself be blinded by any sort
      of circumstantial evidence. The evidence was black&mdash;in black on white&mdash;written
      by a black-hearted schemer, and delivered by a big, fat black man, who was
      utterly road-weary, to the commissioner in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sepoy mutiny that had been planned so carefully had started to take
      charge too soon. News had arrived of native regiments whose officers had
      been obliged against their will to disarm and disband them, and the
      loyalty of other regiments was seriously called in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the men whose blindness was responsible for the possibility of mutiny
      were only made blinder by the evidence of coming trouble. With a dozen
      courses open to them, any one of which might have saved the situation,
      they deliberately chose a thirteenth&mdash;two-forked toboggan-slide into
      destruction. To prove their misjudged confidence in the native army, they
      actually disbanded the irregulars led by Byng the Brigadier&mdash;removed
      the European soldiers wherever possible from ammunition-magazine
      guard-duty, replacing them with native companies&mdash;and reprimanded the
      men whose clear sight showed them how events were shaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reprimanded Byng, as though depriving him of his command were not
      enough. When he protested, as he had a right to do, they showed him
      Jaimihr's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahommed Gunga told you, did he? Look at this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter, most concisely and pointedly written, considering the indirect
      phraseology and caution of the East, deliberately accused Mahommed Gunga
      and a certain Alwa, together with all the Rangars of a whole province, of
      scheming with Maharajah Howrah to overthrow the British rule. It
      recommended the immediate arrest of Mahommed Gunga and stern measures
      against the Rangars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose to do about it?&rdquo; inquired Byng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's out of our province. A copy of this letter has been sent to the
      proper quarter, and no doubt the story will be investigated. There have
      been all kinds of stories about suttee being practised in Howrah, and it
      very likely won't be difficult to find a plausible excuse for deposing the
      Maharajah and putting Jaimihr in his place. In the meantime, if Mahommed
      Gunga shows himself in these parts he'll be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Byng did then the sort of thing that was fortunately characteristic of the
      men who rose in the nick of time to seize the reins. He hurried to his
      quarters, packed in its case the sword of honor that had once been given
      him by his Queen, and despatched it without a written line of comment to
      Mahommed Gunga. The native who took it was ordered to ride like the devil,
      overtake Mahommed Gunga on the road to Abu, present the sword without
      explanation, and return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, in spite of himself, had travelled swiftly. The moon lacked
      two nights of being full and two more days would have seen him climbing up
      the fourteen-mile rock road that leads up the purple flanks of Abu, when
      the ex-trooper of Irregulars cantered from a dust cloud, caught up
      Mahommed Gunga, who was riding, as usual, in the rear, and handed him the
      sword. He held it out with both hands. Mahommed Gunga seized it by the
      middle, and neither said a word for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence Mahommed Gunga drew the blade&mdash;saw Byng's name engraved
      close to the hilt&mdash;recognized the sword, and knew the sender&mdash;thought&mdash;and
      mistook the meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take this word back. 'I will return the sword, with honor added to
      it, when the peace of India is won.' Say that, and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rest my horse for a day or two,&rdquo; said the trooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither thou nor yet thy horse will have much rest this side of Eblis!&rdquo;
       said Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Ride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trooper wheeled and went with a grin and a salute which he repeated
      twice, leaning back from the saddle for a last look at the man of his own
      race whom Byng had chosen to exalt. He felt himself honored merely to have
      carried the sword. Mahommed Gunga removed his own great sabre and handed
      it to one of his own five whom he overtook; then he buckled on the sword
      of honor and spurred until he rode abreast of Cunningham, a hundred yards
      or more ahead of the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did Byng-bahadur say a word or two about listening to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I will now say things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the Brigadier had sent no message other than the sword was
      probably the Rajput's chief reason for talking in riddles still to
      Cunningham. The silence went straight to his Oriental heart&mdash;so to
      speak, set the key for him to play to. But he knew, too, that Cunningham's
      youth would be a handicap should it come to argument; what he was looking
      for was not a counsellor or some one to make plans, for the plans had all
      been laid and cross-laid by the enemy, and Mahommed Gunga knew it. He
      needed a man of decision&mdash;to be flung blindfold into unexpected and
      unexpecting hell wrath, who would lead, take charge, decide on the
      instant, and lead the way out again, with men behind him who would
      recognize decision when they saw it. So he spoke darkly. He understood
      that the sword meant &ldquo;Things have started,&rdquo; so with a soldier's courage he
      proceeded to head Cunningham toward the spot where hell was loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say ahead!&rdquo; smiled Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder, sahib, lies Abu. Yonder to the right lies thy road now, not
      forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have orders to report at Abu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, sahib, orders to advise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you advising me to disobey orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rajput hesitated. &ldquo;Sahib, have I anything to gain,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;by
      offering the wrong advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't imagine so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise, now, that we&mdash;thou and I, sahib, and my five turn off here&mdash;yonder,
      where the other trail runs&mdash;letting the party proceed to Abu without
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is need of haste, sahib. At Abu there will be delay&mdash;much talk
      with Everton-sahib, and who knows?&mdash;perhaps cancellation of the plan
      to send thee on to Howrah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be damned glad, Mahommed Gunga, not to have to go there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, look! What is this I wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, sahib&mdash;this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Cunningham noticed the fine European workmanship on the
      sword-hilt, and realized that the Rajput's usual plain, workmanlike weapon
      had been replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Byng-bahadur's sword of honor! It reached me a few minutes ago.
      The man who brought it is barely out of sight. It means, sahib, that the
      hour to act is come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib&mdash;this sending thee to Howrah is my doing? Since the day when I
      first heard that the son of Pukka Cunnigan-bahadur was on his way I have
      schemed and planned and contrived to this end. It was at word from me that
      Byng-bahadur signed the transfer papers&mdash;otherwise he would have kept
      thee by him. There are owls&mdash;old women&mdash;men whom Allah has
      deprived of judgment&mdash;drunkards&mdash;fools&mdash;in charge at
      Peshawur and in other places; but there are certain men who know.
      Byng-bahadur knows. I know&mdash;and I will show the way! Let me lead,
      sahib, for a little while, and I will show thee what to lead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this sword, sahib, mean nothing? Did Byng-bahadur send it me for
      fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's the idea? I can't disobey orders, and ride off to&mdash;God
      knows where&mdash;without some excuse. You'll have to tell me why. What's
      the matter? What's happening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Byng-bahadur sent not one word to me when he sent this sword. To thee he
      said: 'Listen to Mahommed Gunga, even when he seems to lie!' I know that,
      for he told me he had said it. To me he said: 'Take charge, Mahommed
      Gunga, when the hour comes, and rub his innocent young nose hard as you
      like into the middle of the mess!' Ay, sahib, so said he. It is now that I
      take charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But,' said the nylghau, and the wolf-pack had him! 'But,' said the
      tiger, and the trap door shut! 'But,' said the Hindoo, and a priest
      betrayed him! But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I never knew thy father make
      much use of that word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;I have my orders, Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib&mdash;this sword is a sword of honor&mdash;it stands for
      Byng-bahadur's honor. I have it in my keeping. Mine own honor is a matter
      somewhat dear to me, and I have kept it clean these many years. Now I ask
      to keep thine honor, too, awhile&mdash;making three men's honor. If I
      fail, then thou and I and Byng-bahadur all go down together in good
      company. If I fail not, then, sahib&mdash;Allah is contented when his
      honor stands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham drew rein and looked him in the eyes. Gray eyes met brown and
      neither flinched; each read what men of mettle only can read when they see
      it&mdash;the truth, the fearlessness, the thought they understand because
      it lives with them. Cunningham held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some thirty minutes later Cunningham, Mahommed Gunga, and the five, with a
      much-diminished mule-train bumping in their wake, were headed westward on
      a dry, hot trail, while the time-expired and convalescent escort plodded
      south. The escort carried word that Cunningham had heard of trouble to the
      west, and had turned off to investigate it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Quoth little red jackal, famishing, &ldquo;Lo,
    Yonder a priest and a soldier go;
    You can see farthest, and you ought to know,&mdash;
    Which shall I wander with, carrion crow?&rdquo;
     The crow cawed back at him, &ldquo;Ignorant beast!
    Soldiers get glory, but none of the feast;
    Soldiers work hardest, and snaffle the least.
    Take my advice on it&mdash;Follow the priest!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      IT was two hours after sunrise on the second day that followed
      Cunningham's desertion of his party when he and Mahommed Gunga first
      caught sight of a blue, baked rock rising sheer out of a fringe of green
      on the dazzling horizon. It was a freak of nature&mdash;a point pushed
      through the level crust of bone-dry earth, and left to glitter there
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my cousin Alwa's place!&rdquo; exclaimed Mahommed Gunga, and he seemed
      to draw a world of consolation from the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight loosed his tongue at last; he rode by Cunningham, and deigned an
      explanation now, at least, of what had led to what might happen. He wasted
      little breath on prophecy, but he was eloquent in building up a basis from
      which Cunningham might draw his own deductions. They had ridden through
      the cool of the night in easy stages, and should have camped at dawn; but
      Mahommed Gunga had insisted that the tired animals could carry them for
      three hours longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier's horse must rest at the other end sahib,&rdquo; he had laughed. &ldquo;Who
      knows that they have not sent from Abu to arrest both thee and me?&rdquo; And he
      had not vouchsafed another word until, over the desert glare, his cousin's
      aerie had blazed out, beating back the molten sun-rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks hotter than the horns of hell!&rdquo; said Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horns of hell, sahib, are what we leave behind us! They grow hot now!
      Thy countrymen&mdash;the men who hated thee so easily&mdash;heated them
      and sit now between them for their folly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you mean? 'Pon my soul and honor, Risaldar, you talk more riddles
      in five minutes than I ever heard before in all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be many riddles I have not told yet&mdash;riddles of which I do not
      know the answer. Read me this one. Why did the British Government annex
      the state of Oudh? All the best native soldiers came from Oudh, or nearly
      all. They were loyal once; but can a man be fairly asked to side against
      his own? If Oudh should rise in rebellion, what would the soldiers do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno, I'm sure,&rdquo; said Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read me this one, then. By pacifying both Mohammedan and Hindoo and by
      letting both keep their religion, by sometimes playing one against the
      other and by being just, the British Government has become supreme from
      the Himalayas to the ocean. Can you tell me why they now issue cartridges
      for the new rifles that are soaked in the fat of cows and pigs, thus
      insulting both Mohammedan and Hindoo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know it was so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, it is! These damned new cartridges and this new drill-sahib, I&mdash;I
      who am loyal to the marrow of my bones&mdash;would no more touch those
      cartridges&mdash;nor bite them, as the drill decrees&mdash;than I would
      betray thee! Pig's fat! Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spat with Mohammedan eloquence and wiped his lips on his tunic sleeve
      before resuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, like a flint and steel, to light the train that they have laid,
      they loose these missionaries, in a swarm, from one end of India to the
      other. Why? What say one and all? Mohammedan and Hindoo both say it is a
      plot, first to make them lose their own religion by defilement, then to
      make Christians of them! Foolishness to talk thus? Nay! It was foolishness
      to act thus!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, peace follows in the wake of soldiers, as we know. Time and time
      again the peace of India has been ripped asunder at the whim of priests!
      These padre people, preaching new damnation everywhere, are the flint and
      steel for the tinder of the cartridge fat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew you to croak before, Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor am I croaking. I am praising Allah, who has sent thee now to the
      place whence the wind will come to fan the hell flames that presently will
      burn. The wind will blow hot or cold&mdash;for or against the government&mdash;according
      as you and I and certain others act when opportunity arrives! See yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been seen, evidently, for horsemen&mdash;looking like black ants
      on the desert&mdash;seemed to have crawled from the bowels of the living
      rock and were galloping in their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; asked Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, indeed! But they have yet to discover whether we are friends.
      They set me thinking, sahib. Alwa is well known on this country-side and
      none dare raid his place; few would waste time trying. Therefore, it is
      all one to him who passes along this road; and he takes no trouble, as a
      rule, to send his men out in skirmishing order when a party comes in view.
      Why, then, does he trouble now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't say. I don't know Alwa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking, sahib, that the cloud has burst at last! A blood-red
      cloud! Alwa is neither scare-monger nor robber; when he sends out armed
      men to inspect strangers on the sky-line, there is war! Sahib, I grow
      young again! Had people listened to me&mdash;had they called me anything
      but fool when I warned them&mdash;thou and I would have been cooped up now
      in Agra, or in Delhi, or Lucknow, or Peshawur! Now we are free of the
      plains of Rajputana&mdash;within a ride of fifty of my blood-relations,
      and they each within reach of others! Ho! I can hear the thunder of a
      squadron at my back again! I am young, sahib&mdash;young! My old joints
      loosen! Allah send the cloud has burst at last&mdash;I bring to two
      thousand Rangars a new Cunnigan-bahadur! Thy father's son shall learn what
      Cunnigan-bahadur taught!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lapsed into silence, watching the advancing horsemen, who swooped down
      on them in an ever-closing fan formation. His tired horse sensed the
      thrill that tingled through its rider's veins, and pranced again, curving
      his neck and straining at the bit until Mahommed Gunga steadied him. The
      five behind&mdash;even the mule-drivers too&mdash;detected excitement in
      the air, and the little column closed in on its leaders. All eyes watched
      the neck-and-neck approach of Alwa's men, until Cunningham at last could
      see their turbans and make out that they were Rangars, not Hindoos. Then
      he and the Risaldar drew rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were twenty who raced toward them, but no Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as I thought!&rdquo; declared Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;It is war, sahib! He has
      summoned men from his estates. As a rule, he can afford but ten men for
      that fort of his, and he would not send all his men to meet us&mdash;he
      has a garrison up yonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like blown dust-devils the twenty raced to them, and drew up thundering
      within a lance-length. A sword-armed Rangar with a little gold lace on his
      sleeve laughed loud as he saluted, greeting Mahommed Gunga first. The
      Risaldar accepted his salute with iron dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive him, sahib!&rdquo; he whispered to Cunningham. &ldquo;The jungli knows no
      better! He will learn whom to salute first when Alwa has said his say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cunningham was in no mood just then to stand on military ceremony or
      right of precedence. He was too excited, too inquisitive, too occupied
      with the necessity for keeping calm in the face of what most surely looked
      like the beginning of big happenings. These horsemen of Alwa's rode, and
      looked, and laughed like soldiers, new-stripped of the hobble ropes of
      peace, and their very seat in the untanned saddles&mdash;tight down,
      loose-swaying from the hips, and free&mdash;was confirmation of Mahommed
      Gunga's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wheeled in a cloud and led the way, opening a little in the centre to
      let the clouds of sand their horses kicked up blow to the right and left
      of Cunningham and his men. Not a word was spoken&mdash;not a question
      asked or a piece of news exchanged&mdash;until the whole party halted at
      the foot of Alwa's fortress home&mdash;a great iron gate in front of them
      and garden land on either side&mdash;watered by the splashing streamlet
      from the heights above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men of the house of Kachwaha have owned and held this place, sahib, since
      Allah made it!&rdquo; whispered Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Men say that Alwa has no right
      to it; they lie! His father's father won the dower-right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by the rising of the iron gate. It seemed solid,
      without even an eyehole in it. It was wide enough to let four horses under
      side by side, and for all its weight it rose as suddenly and evenly as
      though a giant's hand had lifted it. Immediately behind it, like an actor
      waiting for the stage-curtain to rise, Alwa bestrode his war-horse in the
      middle of a roadway. He saluted with drawn sabre, and this time Cunningham
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly the man who had led the gallopers and had saluted
      Mahommed Gunga spurred his horse up close to Cunningham and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, sahib! I did not know! Am I forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cunningham, remembering then that a Rajput, and a Rangar more
      particularly, thinks about points of etiquette before considering what to
      eat. Alwa growled out a welcome, rammed his sabre home, and wheeled
      without another word, showing the way at a walk&mdash;which was all a wild
      goat could have accomplished&mdash;up a winding road, hewn out of the
      solid mountain, that corkscrewed round and round upon itself until it gave
      onto the battlemented summit. There he dismounted, ordered his men to
      their quarters, and for the first time took notice of his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thy missionary and his daughter, three horses for thee, and thy
      man,&rdquo; he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Ali Partab bring them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay. It was I brought Ali Partab and the rest! My promise is redeemed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga thrust his sword-hilt out and smiled back at him. &ldquo;I
      present Raff-Cunnigan-sahib&mdash;son of Pukka-Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo; he
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa drew himself up to his full height and eyed young Cunningham as a
      buyer eyes a war-horse, inch by inch. The youngster, who had long since
      learned to actually revel in the weird sensation of a hundred pairs of
      eyes all fixed on him at once, felt this one man's gaze go over him as
      though he were being probed. He thanked his God he had no fat to be
      detected, and that his legs were straight, and that his tunic fitted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, bahadur,&rdquo; said Alwa slowly. &ldquo;I knew thy father. So&mdash;thou&mdash;art&mdash;his&mdash;son.
      Welcome. There is room here always for a guest. I have other guests with
      whom you might care to speak. I will have a room made ready. Have I leave
      to ask questions of my cousin here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham bowed in recognition of his courtesy, and walked away to a
      point whence he could look from the beetling parapet away and away across
      desert that shone hot and hazy-rimmed on every side. If this were a man on
      whom he must depend for following&mdash;if any of all the more than hints
      dropped by the risaldar were true&mdash;it seemed to him that his
      reception was a little too chilly to be hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute or two he turned his eyes away from the dazzling plain
      below and faced about to inspect the paved courtyard. Round it, on three
      sides of a parallelogram, there ran a beautifully designed and wonderfully
      worked-out veranda-fronted building, broken here and there by cobbled
      passages that evidently led to other buildings on the far edge of the
      rock. In the centre, covered by a roof like a temple-dome in miniature,
      was the ice-cold spring, whose existence made the fort tenable. Under the
      veranda, on a long, low lounge, was a sight that arrested his attention&mdash;held
      him spell-bound&mdash;drew him, tingling in a way he could not have
      explained&mdash;drew him&mdash;drew him, slow-footed, awkward, red&mdash;across
      the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Mahommed Gunga swear aloud; he recognized the wording of the
      belly-growled Rangar oath; but it did not occur to him that what he saw&mdash;what
      was drawing him&mdash;could be connected with it. He looked straight ahead
      and walked ahead&mdash;reached the edge of the veranda&mdash;took his
      helmet off&mdash;and stood still, feeling like an idiot, with the sun full
      on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd advise you to step into the shade,&rdquo; said a voice that laughed more
      sweetly than the chuckling spring. &ldquo;I don't know who you are, but I'm more
      glad to see you than I ever was in my life to see anybody. I can't get up,
      because I'm too stiff; the ride to here from Howrah City all but killed
      me, and I'm only here still because I couldn't ride another yard. My
      father will be out in a moment. He's half-dead too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Miss McClean. My father was a missionary in Howrah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded to a chair beside her, and Cunningham took it, feeling awkward,
      as men of his type usually do when they meet a woman in a strange place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world did you get in?&rdquo; she asked him. &ldquo;It's two days now since
      the Alwa-sahib told us that the whole country is in rebellion. How is it
      that you managed to reach here? According to Alwa, no white man's life is
      safe in the open, and he only told me today that he wouldn't let me go
      away even if I were well enough to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First I've heard of rebellion!&rdquo; said Cunningham aghast at the notion of
      hearing news like that a second hand, and from a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Alwa told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't had time to, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, you'd better ask him. If what he say is true&mdash;and I think he
      tells the truth&mdash;the natives mean to kill us all, or drive us out of
      India. Of course they can't do it, but they mean to try. He has been more
      than kind&mdash;more than hospitable&mdash;more than chivalrous. Just
      because he gave his word to another Rangar, he risked his life about a
      dozen times to get my father and me and Ali Partab out of Howrah. But, I
      don't think he quite liked doing it&mdash;and&mdash;this is in confidence&mdash;if
      I were asked&mdash;and speaking just from intuition&mdash;I should say he
      is in sympathy with the rebellion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; asked Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several days&mdash;ten, I think. It seemed strange at first and rather
      awful to be lodged on a rock like this in a section of a Rangar's harem!
      Yes, there are several women here behind the scenes, but I only see the
      waiting-women. I've forgotten time; the news about rebellion seems too
      awful to leave room for any other thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the Rangar to whom Aliva gave his word? Not Mahommed Gunga, by
      any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm&mdash;!&rdquo; Cunningham clipped off the participle just in time.
      &ldquo;There is something, then, in the talk about rebellion! That man's been
      talking in riddles to me ever since I came to India, and it looks as
      though he knew long in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to cross-examine Miss McClean rigorously, even at the risk of
      seeming either rude or else frightened; but before his lips could frame
      another question he caught sight of Mahommed Gunga making signals to him.
      He affected to ignore the signals. He objected to being kept in the dark
      so utterly, and wished to find out a little for himself before listening
      to what the Rangars had to say. But Mahommed Gunga started over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not hear the remark Mahommed Gunga made to Alwa over his shoulder
      as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I remembered there was a woman of his own race here, I would have
      plunged him straight into the fighting! Now there will be the devil first
      to pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has decision in at least one thing!&rdquo; grinned Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that I think thou lackest, cousin!&rdquo; came the hot retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa turned his back with a shake of his head and a thin-lipped smile&mdash;then
      disappeared through a green door in the side of what seemed like solid
      rock. A moment later Mahommed Gunga stood near Cunningham, saluting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ask the favor of a consultation, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham rose, a shade regretfully, and followed into the rock-walled
      cavern into which Alwa had preceded them. It was nearly square&mdash;a
      hollow bubble in the age-old lava&mdash;axe-trimmed many hundred years
      ago. What light there was came in through three long slits that gave an
      archer's view of the plain and of the zigzag roadway from the iron gate
      below. It was cool, for the rock roof was fifty or more feet thick, and
      the silence of it seemed like the nestling-place of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on wooden benches round the walls, with their soldier legs
      stretched out in front of them. Alwa broke silence first, and it was of
      anything but peace he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;now, let us see whose throats we are to slit!&rdquo; he started
      cheerfully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Achilles had a tender spot
    That even guarding gods forgot,
            When clothing him in armor;
    And I have proved this charge o' mine
    For fear, and sloth, and vice, and wine,
            But clear forgot the charmer!
</pre>
    <p>
      THE Alwa-sahib knew more English than he was willing to admit. In the
      first place, he had the perfectly natural dislike of committing his
      thoughts to any language other than his own when anything serious was the
      subject of discussion; in the second place, he had little of Mahommed
      Gunga's last-ditch loyalty. Not that Alwa could be disloyal; he had not
      got it in him; but as yet he had seen no good reason for pledging himself
      and his to the British cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for more than ten minutes he chose to sit in apparent dudgeon, his
      hands folded in front of him on the hilt of his tremendous sabre, growling
      out a monologue in his own language for Mahommed Gunga's benefit. Then
      Mahommed Gunga silenced him with an uplifted hand, and turned to translate
      to Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem, sahib, that even while we rode to Abu the rebellion was
      already raging! It burst suddenly. They have mutinied at Berhampur, and
      slain their officers. Likewise at Meerut, and at all the places in
      between. At Kohat, in this province they have slain every white man,
      woman, and child, and also at Arjpur and Sohlat. The rebels are hurrying
      to Delhi, where they have proclaimed new rule, under the descendants of
      the old-time kings. Word of all this came before dawn today, by a
      messenger from Maharajah Howrah to my cousin here. My cousin stands
      pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne; Howrah is against the British;
      Jaimihr, his brother, is in arms against Howrah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did the Alwa-sahib pledge himself to Howrah's cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga&mdash;who knew quite well&mdash;saw fit to translate the
      question. With a little sign of irritation Alwa growled his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, sahib, that for the safety of two Christian missionaries, for
      whom he has no esteem at all, he was forced to swear allegiance to a
      Hindoo whom he esteems even less. He says that his word is given!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he mean that he would like me and the missionaries to leave his home
      at once&mdash;do we embarrass him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mahommed Gunga&mdash;this time with a grin&mdash;saw fit to ask
      before he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'God forbid,' sahib; 'a guest is guest!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham reflected for a moment, then leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him this!&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I am glad to be his guest, but, if this
      story of rebellion is true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, sahib! More than true! There is much more to be told!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I can only accept his hospitality as the representative of my
      government! I stay here officially, or not at all. It is for him to
      answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Allah be praised!&rdquo; swore Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;I knew we had a man! That
      is well said, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of Cunnigan-bahadur is welcome here on any terms at all!&rdquo; growled
      Alwa when Mahommed Gunga had translated. &ldquo;All the rebels in all India, all
      trying at once, would fail to take this fort of mine, had I a larger
      garrison. But what Rangar on this countryside will risk his life and
      estates on behalf of a cause that is already lost? If they come to hold my
      fort for me, the rebels will burn their houses. The British Raj is doomed.
      We Rangars have to play for our own stake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mahommed Gunga rose and paced the floor like a man in armor, tugging
      at his beard and kicking at his scabbard each time that he turned at
      either end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Rangar in this province would have had one yard of land to his name
      but for this man's father?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;In his day we fought, all of us,
      for what was right! We threw our weight behind him when he led, letting
      everything except obedience go where the devil wanted it! What came of
      that? Good tithes, good report, good feeling, peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, the zemindary laws!&rdquo; growled Alwa. &ldquo;Then the laws that took
      away from us full two-thirds of our revenue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had had no revenue, except for Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It dawned on Cunningham exactly why and how he came to be there! He
      understood now that Mahommed Gunga had told nothing less than truth when
      he declared it had been through his scheming, and no other man's, that he&mdash;Cunningham&mdash;whose
      sole thought was to be a soldier, had been relegated to oblivion and
      politics! He understood why Byng had signed the transfer, and he knew&mdash;knew&mdash;knew&mdash;deep
      down inside him that his chance had come!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that another Cunningham is to have the honor of preserving
      Rangars' titles for them,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;How many horsemen could the
      Alwa-sahib raise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would depend!&rdquo; Alwa was in no mood to commit himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the most&mdash;at a pinch&mdash;in case of direst need, and for a
      cause that all agreed on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horsed and armed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Alwa-sahib&mdash;are you pledged to fight against the British?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in so many words. I swore to uphold Howrah on his throne. He is
      against the British.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swore to help smash his brother, Jaimihr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jaimihr too is against the British?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr is for Jaimihr, and has a personal affair with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think,&rdquo; said Cunningham, getting up. &ldquo;I can think better alone.
      D'you mind if I go outside for a while, and come back later to tell you
      what I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa arose and held the door open for him&mdash;stood and watched him
      cross the courtyard&mdash;then turned and laughed at Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight over to the woman!&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;This leader of thine seems in
      leading-strings himself already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga cursed, and cursed again as his own eyes confirmed what
      Alwa said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried him all the ways there are, except that one way!&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;May Allah forgive my oversight! I should have got him well entangled with
      a woman before he reached Peshawur! He should have been heart-broken by
      this time&mdash;rightly, he should have been desperate with unrequited
      love! Byng-bahadur could have managed it! Byng-bahadur would have managed
      it, had I thought to advise him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood, looking over very gloomily at Cunningham, making a dozen wild
      plans for getting rid of Miss McClean&mdash;by no means forgetting poison&mdash;and
      the height of Alwa's aerie from the plain below! He would have been
      considerably calmer, could he have heard what Cunningham and Miss McClean
      were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary was with her now&mdash;ill and exhausted from the combined
      effects of excitement, horror, and the unaccustomed ride across the desert&mdash;most
      anxious for his daughter&mdash;worried, to the verge of desperation, by
      the ghastly news of the rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cunningham, I hope you are the forerunner of a British force?&rdquo; he
      hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cunningham was too intent on cross-examination to waste time on giving
      any information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to tell me, quite quietly and without hurry, all you can about
      Howrah,&rdquo; he said, sitting close to Miss McClean. &ldquo;I want you to understand
      that I am the sole representative of my government in the whole district,
      and that whatever can be done depends very largely on what information I
      can get. I have been talking to the Alwa-sahib, but he seems too obsessed
      with his own predicament to be able to make things quite clear. Now, go
      ahead and tell me what you know about conditions in the city. Remember,
      you are under orders! Try and consider yourself a scout, reporting
      information to your officer. Tell me every single thing, however
      unimportant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the far side of the courtyard Alwa and Mahommed Gunga had gone to lean
      over the parapet and watch something that seemed to interest both of them
      intently. There were twenty or more men, lined round the ramparts on the
      lookout, and they all too seemed spellbound, but Cunningham was too
      engrossed in Miss McClean's story of the happenings in Howrah City to take
      notice. Now and then her father would help her out with an interjected
      comment; occasionally Cunningham would stop her with a question, or would
      ask her to repeat some item; but, for more than an hour she spun a
      clear-strung narrative that left very little to imagination and included
      practically all there was to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; asked Cunningham &ldquo;that this brute Jaimihr really wants to
      make you Maharanee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't say,&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;You know, there have been several
      instances of European women having practically sold themselves to native
      princes; there have been stories&mdash;I have heard them&mdash;of English
      women marrying Rajahs, and regretting it. There is no reason why he should
      not be in earnest, and he certainly seemed to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this treasure? Of course, I have heard tales about it, but I thought
      they were just tales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That treasure is really there, and its amount must be fabulous. I have
      been told that there are jewels there which would bring a Rajah's ransom,
      and gold enough to offset the taxes of the whole of India for a year or
      two. I've no doubt the stories are exaggerated, but the treasure is real
      enough, and big enough to make the throne worth fighting for. Jaimihr
      counts on being able to break the power of the priests and broach the
      treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jaimihr is&mdash;er&mdash;in love with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried very hard to prove it, in his own objectionable way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jaimihr wants the throne&mdash;and Howrah wants to send a force
      against the British, but dare not move because of Jaimihr&mdash;I have
      Mahommed Gunga and five or six men to depend on&mdash;the Rangars are
      sitting on the fence&mdash;and the government has its hands full! The
      lookout's bright! I think I see the way through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are forgetting me.&rdquo; The missionary spread his broad stooped
      shoulders. &ldquo;I am a missionary first, but next to that I have my country's
      cause more at heart than anything. I place myself under your orders, Mr.
      Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too,&rdquo; said Miss McClean. She was looking at him keenly as he gazed away
      into nothing through slightly narrowed eyes. Vaguely, his attitude
      reminded her of a picture she had once seen of the Duke of Wellington;
      there was the same mastery, the same far vision, the same poise of
      self-contained power. His nose was not like the Iron Duke's, for young
      Cunningham's had rather more tolerance in its outline and less of Roman
      overbearing; but the eyes, and the mouth, and the angle of the jaw were so
      like Wellesley's as to force a smile. &ldquo;A woman isn't likely to be much use
      in a case like this&mdash;but, one never knows. My country comes first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he answered quietly. And as he turned his head to flash one
      glance at each of them, she recognized what Mahommed Gunga had gloated
      over from the first&mdash;the grim decision, that will sacrifice all&mdash;take
      full responsibility&mdash;and use all means available for the one
      unflinching purpose of the game in hand. She knew that minute, and her
      father knew, that if she could be used&mdash;in any way at all&mdash;he
      would make use of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; she nodded. &ldquo;I'll obey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will not prevent!&rdquo; said Duncan McClean, smiling and straightening
      his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham left them and walked over to the parapet, where the whole
      garrison was bending excitedly now above the battlement. There were more
      than forty men, most of them clustered near Alwa and Mahommed Gunga.
      Mahommed Gunga was busy counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight hundred!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Cunningham drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight hundred what, Mahommed Gunga? Come and see, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham leaned over, and beheld a mounted column, trailing along the
      desert road in wonderfully good formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they from?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr's men, from Howrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means,&rdquo; growled Alwa, &ldquo;that the Hindoo pig Jaimihr has more than
      half the city at his back. He has left behind ten men for every one he
      brings with him&mdash;sufficient to hold Howrah in check. Otherwise he
      would never have dared come here. He hopes to settle his little private
      quarrel with me first, before dealing with his brother! Who told him, I
      wonder, that I was pledged to Howrah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He reckons he has caught thee napping in this fort of thine!&rdquo; laughed
      Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;He means to bottle up the Rangars' leader, and so
      checkmate all of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eight hundred horsemen on the plain below rode carelessly through
      Alwa's gardens, leaving trampled confusion in their wake, and lined up&mdash;with
      Jaimihr at their head&mdash;immediately before the great iron gate. A
      moment later four men rode closer and hammered on it with their
      lance-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down and speak to them!&rdquo; commanded Alwa, and a man dropped down the
      zigzag roadway like a goat, taking short cuts from level to level, until
      he stood on a pinnacle of rock that overhung the gate. Ten minutes later
      he returned, breathing hard with the effort of his climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr demands the missionaries&mdash;particularly the Miss-sahib&mdash;also
      quarters and food!&rdquo; he reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarters and food he shall have!&rdquo; swore Alwa, looking down at the Prince
      who sat his charger in the centre of the roadway. &ldquo;Did he deign a threat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that in fifteen minutes he will burst the gate in, unless he is
      first admitted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duncan McClean walked over, limping painfully, and peered over the
      precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfriendly?&rdquo; he asked, and Mahommed Gunga heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy friend Jaimihr, sahib! His teeth are all but visible from here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He demands admittance&mdash;also thee and thy daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib&mdash;art thou a priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, then, who prays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For dead men, ever? For the dying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aloud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On occasion, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then pray now! There will be many dead and dying on the plain below in
      less than fifteen minutes! Hindoos, for all I know, would benefit by
      prayer. They have too many gods, and their gods are too busy fighting for
      ascendancy to listen. Pray thou, a little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a long shout from the plain, and Alwa sent a man again to
      listen. He came back with a message that Jaimihr granted amnesty to all
      who would surrender, and that he would be pleased to accept Alwa's
      allegiance if offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will offer the braggart something in the way of board and lodging that
      will astonish him!&rdquo; growled Alwa. &ldquo;Eight men to horse! The first eight!
      That will do! Back to the battlement, the rest of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had raced for the right to loose themselves against eight hundred!

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    OH, duck and run&mdash;the hornets come!
    Oh, jungli!  Clear the way!
    The nest's ahum&mdash;the hornets come!
    The sharp-stinged, harp-winged hornets come!
    Nay, jungli!  When the hornets come,
            It isn't well to stay!
</pre>
    <p>
      ALWA ordered ten men down into the bowels of the rock itself, where great
      wheels with a chain attached to them were forced round to lift the gate.
      Next he stationed a signaller with a cord in either hand, above the
      parapet, to notify the men below exactly when to set the simple machinery
      in motion. His eight clattered out from the stables on the far side of the
      rock, and his own charger was brought to him, saddled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a second, it was evident why Raputs do not rule in Rajputana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ride too with my men!&rdquo; declared Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! This is my affair&mdash;my private quarrel with Jaimihr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga turned to Ali Partab, who had been a shadow to him ever
      since he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out my five, and bring my charger!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I say!&rdquo; Alwa had his hand already on his sabre hilt. &ldquo;There is room
      for eight and no more. Four following four abreast, and one ahead to lead
      them. I and my men know how to do this. I and my men have a personal
      dispute with Jaimihr. Stay thou here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga's five and Ali Partab came clattering out so fast as to
      lead to the suspicion that their horses had been already saddled. Mahommed
      Gunga mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead on, cousin!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I will follow thy lead, but I come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Alwa did what a native nearly always will do. He turned to a man not
      of his own race, whom he believed he could trust to be impartial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib&mdash;have I no rights in my own house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you have,&rdquo; said Cunningham, who was wondering more than
      anything what weird, wild trick these horsemen meant to play. No man in
      his senses would have dared to ride a horse at more than foot-pace down
      the path. Was there another path? he wondered. At least, if eight men were
      about to charge into eight hundred, it would be best to keep his good
      friend Mahommed Gunga out of it, he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risaldar!&rdquo; The veteran was always most amenable to reason when addressed
      by his military title. &ldquo;Who of us two is senior&mdash;thou or I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Allah, not I, sahib! I am thy servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your service, and I order you to stay with your men up here with
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga saluted and dismounted, and his six followed suit, looking
      as disappointed as children just deprived of a vacation. Alwa wheeled his
      horse in front of Cunningham and saluted too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that service, sahib, I am thy friend!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That was right
      and reasonable, and a judgement quickly given! Thy friend, bahadur!&rdquo; He
      spoke low on purpose, but Mahommed Gunga heard him, caught Cunningham's
      eye, and grinned. He saw a way to save his face, at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a trick well turned, sahib!&rdquo; he whispered, as Alwa moved away.
      &ldquo;Alwa will listen in future when Cunnigan-bahadur speaks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down and tell Jaimihr that I come in person!&rdquo; ordered Alwa, and the
      man dropped down the cliff side for the third time; they could hear his
      voice, high-pitched, resounding off the rock, and they caught a faint
      murmur of the answer. Below, Jaimihr could be seen waiting patiently,
      checking his restive war-horse with a long-cheeked bit, and waiting, ready
      to ride under the gate the moment it was opened. Rosemary McClean came
      over; she and Cunningham and the missionary leaned together over the
      battlement and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might do some execution with rifles from here,&rdquo; Cunningham suggested;
      &ldquo;I believe I'll send for mine.&rdquo; But Mahommed Gunga overheard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib! No shooting will be necessary. Watch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a clatter of hoofs, and they all looked up in time to see the
      tails of the last four chargers disappearing round the corner, downward.
      They had gone&mdash;full pelt&mdash;down a path that a man might hesitate
      to take! From where they stood, there was an archer's view of every inch
      of the only rock-hewn road that led from the gate to the summit of the
      cliff; an enemy who had burst the gate in would have had to climb in the
      teeth of a searching hail of missiles, with little chance of shooting
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see the gate itself, and Jaimihr on the other side. And,
      swooping&mdash;shooting&mdash;sliding down the trail like a storm-loosed
      avalanche, they could see the nine go, led by Alwa. No living creature
      could have looked away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, entirely unconscious of the coming shock, the mounted sepoys waited
      behind Jaimihr in four long, straight lines. Jaimihr himself, with a
      heavy-hilted cimeter held upward at the &ldquo;carry,&rdquo; was about four charger
      lengths beyond the iron screen, ready to spur through. Close by him were a
      dozen, waiting to ram a big beam in and hold up the gate when it had
      opened. And, full-tilt down the gorge, flash-tipped like a thunderbolt,
      gray-turbaned, reckless, whirling death ripped down on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught sound of the hammering hoofs too late. Two gongs boomed in the
      rock. The windlass creaked. Five seconds too late Jaimihr gathered up his
      reins, spurred, wheeled, and shouted to the men behind him. The great gate
      rose, like the jaws of a hungry monster, and the nine&mdash;streaking too
      fast down far too steep a slide to stop themselves&mdash;burst straight
      out under it and struck, as a wind blast smites a poppy-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr was borne backward&mdash;carried off his horse. Alwa and the first
      four rode him down, and crashed through the four-deep line beyond; the
      second four pounced on him, gathered him, and followed. Before the lines
      could form again the whole nine wheeled&mdash;as a wind-eddy spins on its
      own axis&mdash;and burst through back again, the horses racing neck and
      neck, and the sabres cutting down a swath to screech and swear and gurgle
      in among the trampled garden stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back in a line, all eight abreast, Alwa leading only by a
      length. At the opening, four horses&mdash;two on either side&mdash;slid,
      rump to the ground, until their noses touched the rock. Alwa and four
      dashed through and under; the rest recovered, spun on their haunches, and
      followed. The gongs boomed again down in the belly of the rock, and the
      gate clanged shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was good,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga quietly. &ldquo;Now, watch again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost before the words had left his lips, a hail of lead barked out from
      twenty vantage-points, and the smoke showed where some forty men were
      squinting down steel barrels, shooting as rapidly and as rottenly as
      natives of India usually do. They did little execution; but before Alwa
      and his eight had climbed up the steep track to the summit, patting their
      horses' necks and reviling Jaimihr as they came, the cavalry below had
      scampered out of range, leaving their dead and wounded where they lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that for a start, sahib?&rdquo; demanded Mahommed Gunga exultantly, as
      two men deposited the dishevelled Jaimihr on his feet, and the Prince
      glared around him like a man awaking from a dream. &ldquo;How is that for a
      beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As bad as could be!&rdquo; answered Cunningham. &ldquo;It was well executed&mdash;bold&mdash;clever&mdash;anything
      you like, Mahommed Gunga, but&mdash;if I'd been asked I'd have sooner made
      the devil prisoner! Jaimihr is no use at all to us in here. Outside, he'd
      be veritable godsend!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    There is war to the North should I risk and ride forth,
    And a fight to the South, too, I'm thinking;
    There is war in the East, and one battle at least
    In the West between eating and drinking.
    I'm allowed to rejoice in an excellent choice
    Of plans for a soldier of mettle,
    For all of them mean bloody war and rapine.
    So&mdash;on which should a gentleman settle?
</pre>
    <p>
      WITH his muscles strained and twisted (for his Rangar capturers had
      dragged him none too gently) and with his jewelled pugree all awry,
      Jaimihr did not lack dignity. He held his chin high, although he gazed at
      the bubbling spring thirstily; and, thirsty though he must have been, he
      asked no favors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Alwa's men brought him a brass dipper full of water, after washing
      it out first thoroughly and ostentatiously. But Jaimihr smiled. His caste
      forbade. He waved away the offering much as Caesar may have waved aside a
      crown, with an air of condescending mightiness too proud to know contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, help thyself!&rdquo; growled Alwa; and Jaimihr walked to the spring without
      haste, knelt down, and dipped up water with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to a cell with him!&rdquo; commanded Alwa, before the Prince had time to
      slake a more than ordinary thirst. Jaimihr stood upright as four men
      closed in on him, and looked straight in the eyes of every one in turn.
      Rosemary McClean stepped back, to hide herself behind Cunningham's broad
      shoulders, but Jaimihr saw her and his proud smile broadened to a laugh of
      sheer amusement. He let his captors wait for him while he stared straight
      at her, sparing her no fragment of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slew a man once to save thee, sahiba!&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;Why slink away? Have
      I ever been thy enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he folded his arms and walked off between his guards, without even an
      acknowledgment of Alwa's or any other man's existence on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa spat as he wiped blood from his long sabre. He imagined he was doing
      the necessary dirty work out of Miss McClean's sight; but, except hospital
      nurses, there are few women who can see dry blood removed from steel
      without a qualm; she had looked at Alwa to escape Jaimihr's gaze; now she
      looked at Jaimihr's back to avoid the sight of what Alwa was seeing fit to
      do. And with all the woman in her she pitied the prisoner, who had said no
      less than truth when he claimed to have killed a man for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he would have killed a thousand men for her with equal
      generosity and equal disregard of what she thought was right, and she did
      not doubt that he would think himself both justified and worthy of renown
      for doing it. She could have begged his release that minute, had she
      thought for an instant that Alwa would consent, and but for Cunningham.
      She had grown aware of Cunningham's gray eyes, staring straight at her&mdash;summing
      her up&mdash;reading her. And she became conscious of the fact that she
      had met a man whose leave she would like to ask before deciding to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mental acknowledgment brought relief for a few seconds. She was tired.
      The woman in here went out to the man in Cunningham, and she welcomed a
      protector. Then the Scots blood raced to the assistance of the woman, and
      she bridled instantly. Who, then, was this chance-met jackanapes, that she
      should lean on him or look to him for guidance?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebellion that had made her disobey her father back in Howrah City&mdash;the
      spirit that had kept her in Howrah City and had given Jaimihr back cool
      stare for stare&mdash;rallied her to resist&mdash;to ridicule&mdash;to
      rival Cunningham's pretensions. He saw her flush beneath his gaze, and
      turned away to where Mahommed Gunga watched from the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaders of Jaimihr's calvary were arguing. They could be seen gathered
      together out of rifle-shot but in full view of Alwa's rock, and from their
      gestures they seemed to be considering the feasibility of an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it needed no warrior&mdash;it needed less even than ordinary
      intelligence&mdash;to know that as few as forty men could hold that
      fastness against two thousand. Eight hundred would have no chance against
      it. Even two thousand would need engineers, and ordnance, as well as
      plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently half of the little army rode away, back toward Howrah City, and
      the other half proceeded to bivouac where they could watch the
      iron-shuttered entrance and cut off the little garrison from all
      communication or assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well resume our conference,&rdquo; suggested Alwa, with the courtly
      air of a man just arisen from a chair. No one who had not seen him ride
      would have dreamed that he was fresh from snatching a prisoner at the
      bottom of a neck-breaking defile. Cunningham nodded acquiescence and
      followed him, turning to stare again at Miss McClean before he strode away
      with long, even strides that had a reassuring effect on any one who
      watched him. She bridled again, and blushed. But she experienced the weird
      sensation of being read right through before Mahommed Gunga contrived
      adroitly to step into the line of view and so let Cunningham's attention
      fix itself on something else. The Risaldar had made up his mind that love
      was inopportune just then; and he was a man who left no stone unturned&mdash;no
      point unwatched&mdash;when he had sensed a danger. This might be danger
      and it might not be; so he watched. Cunningham was conscious of the sudden
      interruption of a train of thought, but he was not conscious of deliberate
      interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That very young man is an old man,&rdquo; said Duncan McClean, wiping his
      spectacles as he walked beside his daughter to the deep veranda where
      their chairs were side by side. &ldquo;He is a grown man. He has come to man's
      estate. Look at the set of that pair of shoulders. Mark his strength!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect any one of those Rajputs is physically stronger,&rdquo; answered
      Rosemary, in no mood to praise any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of the strength of character he expresses rather than of
      his actual muscles,&rdquo; said McClean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismillah!&rdquo; Alwa was swearing behind the thick teak door that closed
      behind him and Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;We have made a good
      beginning! With the wolf in a trap, what has the goat to dread? Howrah may
      chuckle himself to sleep! And I&mdash;I, too, by the beard of God's
      prophet!&mdash;I, too, may laugh, for, with Jaimihr under lock and key,
      what need is there to ride to the aid of a Hindoo Rajah? I am free again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alwa-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham had fixed him with those calm gray eyes of his, and Mahommed
      Gunga sat down on the nearest bench contented. He could wait for what was
      coming now. He recognized the blossoming of the plant that he had nursed
      through its growth so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listen,&rdquo; answered Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I represent the British Government. I am the only servant of the Company
      within reach. Do you realize that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no orders which entitle me to deal with any crisis such as this.
      But, when my orders were given me, no such crisis was contemplated.
      Therefore, on behalf of the Company, I assume full authority until such
      time as some one senior to me turns up to relieve me. Is all that clear to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga went through considerable pantomime of being angry with a
      fly. He found it necessary to conceal emotion in some way or other. Alwa
      sat motionless and stared straight back at Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sahib,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking to me, then, on that understanding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, huzoor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can raise two thousand men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say fifteen hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely fifteen hundred. Not a sabre less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All horsed and armed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, bahadur. Of what use would be a rabble? I was speaking in terms
      of men able to fight, as one soldier to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you raise those men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a truth, I must, sahib!&rdquo; Alwa laughed. &ldquo;Jaimihr's thousands will be in
      no mind to lie leaderless and let Howrah ride rough-shod over them! They
      know his charity of old! They will be here to claim their Prince within a
      day or two, and without my fifteen hundred how would I stand? Surely,
      bahadur, I will raise my fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Now I will make you a proposal. On behalf of the Company I
      offer you and your men pay at the rate paid to all irregular cavalry on a
      war basis. In return, I demand your allegiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom, sahib? To you or to the Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Company, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! Not I! For the son of Cunnigan-bahadur I would slit the throats of
      half Asia, and then of nine-tenths of the other half! But by the breath of
      God&mdash;by my spurs and this sabre here&mdash;I have had enough of
      pledging! I swore allegiance to Howrah. Being nearly free of that pledge
      by Allah's sending, shall I plunge into another, like a frightened bird
      fluttering from snare to snare? Nay, nay, bahadur! For thyself, for thy
      father's sake, ask any favor. It is granted. But thy Company may stew in
      the grease of its own cartridges for ought I care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham stood up and bowed very slightly&mdash;very stiffly&mdash;very
      punctiliously. Mahommed Gunga leaped to his feet, and came to attention
      with a military clatter. Alwa stared, inclining his head a trifle in
      recognition of the bow, but evidently taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good-by, Alwa-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham stretched out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for your hospitality, and regret exceedingly
      that I cannot avail myself of it further, either for myself or for
      Mahommed Gunga or for Mr. and Miss McClean. As the Company's
      representative, they, of course, look to me for orders and protection, and
      I shall take them away at once. As things are, we can only be a source of
      embarrassment to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;sahib&mdash;huzoor&mdash;it is impossible. You have seen the
      cavalry below. How can you&mdash;how could you get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I am your prisoner I shall certainly leave this place at once. The
      only other condition on which I will stay here is that you pledge your
      allegiance to the Company and take my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, this is&mdash;why&mdash;huzoor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa looked over to Mahommed Gunga and raised his eyebrows eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obey him! I go with him!&rdquo; growled Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, I would like time to think this over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much time? I thought you quick-witted when you made Jaimihr prisoner.
      Has that small success undermined your power of decision? I know my mind.
      Mahommed Gunga knows his, Alwa-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask an hour. There are many points I must consider. There is the
      prisoner for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hand him over to the custody of the first British column we can
      get in touch with, Alwa-sahib. That will relieve you of further
      responsibility to Howrah and will insure a fair trial of any issue there
      may be between yourself and Jaimihr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa scowled. No Rajput likes the thought of litigation where affairs of
      honor are concerned. He felt he would prefer to keep Jaimihr prisoner for
      the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, sahib&rdquo;&mdash;fresh facets of the situation kept appearing to him as
      he sparred for time&mdash;&ldquo;with Jaimihr in a cage I can drive a bargain
      with his brother. While I keep him in the cage, Howrah must respect my
      wishes for fear lest otherwise I loose Jaimihr to be a thorn in his side
      anew. If I hand him to the British, Howrah will know that he is safe and
      altogether out of harm's way; then he will recall what he may choose to
      consider insolence of mine; and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;consider it!&rdquo; said Cunningham, saluting him and making for
      the door, close followed by Mahommed Gunga. The two went out and it left
      Alwa to stride up and down alone&mdash;to wrestle between desire and
      circumspection&mdash;to weigh uncomfortable fact with fact&mdash;and to
      curse his wits that could not settle on the wisest and most creditable
      course. They turned into another chamber of the tunnelled rock, and there
      until long after the hour of law allowed to Alwa they discussed the
      situation too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point was well taken, sahib,&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga, &ldquo;but he should
      have been handled rather less abruptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather less abruptly, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well&mdash;if his mind isn't clear as to which side he'll fight on, I
      don't want him, and that's all!&rdquo; said Cunningham. And Mahommed Gunga
      bitted his impatience fiercely, praying the one God he believed in to
      touch the right scale of the two. Later, Cunningham strode out to pace the
      courtyard in the dark, and the Rajput followed him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    The trapped wolf bared his fangs and swore,
    &ldquo;But set me this time free,
    And I will hunt thee never more!
    By ear and eye and jungle law,
    I'll starve&mdash;I'll faint&mdash;I'll die before
    I bury tooth in thee!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      WHILE Alwa raged alone, and while Mahommed Gunga talked to Cunningham in a
      rock-room near at hand, Rosemary McClean saw fit to take a hand in
      history. It was not her temperament to sit quite idle while others shaped
      her destiny; nor was she given to mere brooding over wrongs. When a wrong
      was being done that she could alter or alleviate it was her way to tackle
      it at once without asking for permission or advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where her chair was placed under the long veranda she could see the
      passage in the rock that led to Jaimihr's cell. She saw his captors take
      him up the passage; she heard the door clang shut on him, and she saw the
      men come back again. She heard them laugh, too, and she overheard a few
      words of a jest that seemed the reason for the laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rajputana, as in other portions of the East, men laugh with meaning as
      a rule, and seldom from mere amusement. Included in the laugh there
      usually lies more than a hint of threat, or hate, or cruelty. And, in
      partial confirmation of the jest she unintentionally overheard, she saw no
      servant go to the chuckling spring to fill a water-jar. She recalled that
      Jaimihr only sipped as much as he could dip up in the hollow of his hand,
      and that physical exertion and suffering of the sort that he had undergone
      produces prodigious thirst in that hot, dry atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited until dark for Cunninham, growing momentarily more restless.
      She recalled that she was a guest of Alwa's, and as such not free to
      interfere with his arrangements or to suggest insinuations anent his
      treatment of prisoners. She recalled the pride of all Rajputs, and its
      accompanying corollary of insolence when offended. There would come no
      good&mdash;she knew&mdash;from asking anybody whether Jaimihr was allowed
      to drink or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, with that middle-aged air of authority laid over the fire and
      ability of youth, would be able, no doubt, to enforce his wishes in the
      matter after finding out the truth about it. But Cunningham did not come;
      and she remembered from a short experience of her own what thirst was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men-at-arms were all on the ramparts now, watching the leaderless
      cavalry on the plain. They had even left the cell door unguarded, for it
      was held shut by a heavy beam that could not be reached from the inside;
      and they were all too few, even all of them together, to hold that rock
      against eight hundred. It was characteristic, though, and Eastern of the
      East, that they should omit to padlock the big beam. It pivoted at its
      centre on a big bronze pin, and even a child could move it from the
      outside; it was only from the inside that it was uncontrollable. From
      inside one could have jerked at the door for a week and the big beam would
      have lain still and efficient in its niche in the rock-wall; but a little
      pressure underneath one end would send it swinging in an arc until it hung
      bolt upright. Then the same child who had pushed it up could have swung
      the teak door wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary, growing momentarily thirstier herself as she thought of the
      probable torture of the prisoner, walked down to the spring and filled a
      dipper, as she had done half a dozen times a day since she first arrived.
      She had carried almost all her own and her father's water, for Joanna was
      generally sleeping somewhere out of view, and no other body-servant had
      been provided for her. There was a fairly big brass pitcher by the spring.
      She filled it. Nobody noticed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she recalled that nobody would notice her if she were to carry the
      brass pitcher in the direction of her room, for she had done that often.
      She picked it up, and she reached the end of the veranda with it without
      having called attention to herself. She set it down then to make quite
      sure that she was unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some movement of the cavalry on the plain below was keeping the eyes
      of the garrison employed. Although a solitary lantern shone full on her,
      she reached the passage leading to the prisoner's cell unseen; and she
      walked on down it, making no attempt to hide or hurry, remembering that
      she was acting out of mercy and had no need to be ashamed. If she were to
      be discovered, then she would be, and that was all about it, except that
      she would probably be able to appeal to Cunningham to save her from
      unpleasant consequences. In any case, she reasoned, she would have done
      good. She was quite ready to get herself and her own in trouble if by
      doing it she could insure that a prisoner had water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not seen. And no one saw her set the jar down by the door. No
      one except the prisoner inside heard her knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you water, Jaimihr-sahib?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The East has a hundred florid epithets for one used in the West; and in a
      land where water is as scarce as gold and far more precious the mention of
      water to a thirsty man calls forth a flood of thought such as only music
      or perhaps religion can produce in luckier climes. Jaimihr waxed eloquent;
      more eloquent than even water might have made him had another&mdash;had
      even another woman&mdash;brought it. He recognized her voice, and said
      things to her that roused all the anger that she knew. She had not come to
      be made love to.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought, though, of his thirst. She remembered that within an hour or
      two he might be raving for another reason and with other words. The big
      beam lifted on her hands with barely more effort than was needed to lift
      up the water-jar; the door opened a little way, and she tried, while she
      passed the water in, to peer through the darkness at the prisoner. But
      there were no windows to that cell, and such dim light as there was came
      from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have bound me, sahiba, in this corner,&rdquo; groaned Jaimihr. &ldquo;I cannot
      reach it. Take it away again! The certainty that it is there and out of
      reach is too great torture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she slipped in through the door, leaving it open a little way&mdash;both
      her hands busy with the brass pitcher and both eyes straining their utmost
      through the gloom&mdash;advancing step by step through mouldy straw that
      might conceal a thousand horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder, perhaps, why I do not escape!&rdquo; said a voice. And then she
      heard the cell door close again gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she could see Jaimihr, for he stood with his back against the door,
      and his head was between her and the little six-inch grating that was all
      the ventilation or light a prisoner in that place was allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you lied to me, even when I brought you water?&rdquo; she answered. She was
      not afraid. She had nerve enough left to pity him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I see that you did not lie. I am still thirsty, sahiba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out both hands, and she could see them dimly. There were no chains
      on them, and he was not bound in any way. She gave him the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass out again before you drink,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;It is not known
      that I am in here, and I would not have it known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could have bitten out her tongue with mortification a moment afterward
      for letting any such admission escape her. She heard him chuckle as he
      drank&mdash;he choked from chuckling, and set the jar down to cough. Then,
      when he had recovered breath again, he answered almost patronizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would be least pleased with you, sahiba? The Rangars, or thy
      father, or the other Englishman? But never mind, sahiba, we are friends. I
      have proved that we are friends. Never have I taken water from the hands
      of any man or any woman not of my own caste. I would have died sooner. It
      was only thou, sahiba, who could make me set aside my caste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She certainly was frightened now. It dawned on her, as it had at once on
      him, that at the least commotion on his part or on hers a dozen Rangars
      would be likely to come running. And just as he had done, she wondered
      what explanation she would give in that case, and who would be likely to
      believe it. To have been caught going to the cell would have been one
      thing; to be caught in it would be another. He divined her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, sahiba. Thou and I are friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, for words would not come. Besides, she was beginning
      to realize that words would be of little help to her. A woman who will
      tell nothing but the truth under any circumstances and will surely keep
      her promises is at a disadvantage when conversing with a man who surely
      will not tell the truth if he can help it and who regards his given word
      with almost equal disrespect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fear, sahiba. I am not afraid to open this door wide and make a
      bid for liberty. It would not be wise, that is all, and thou&mdash;and I
      must deal in wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words came through the dark very evenly&mdash;spaced evenly&mdash;as
      though he weighed each one of them before he voiced it. She gathered the
      impression that he was thinking for his very life. She felt unable to
      think for her own. She felt impelled to listen&mdash;incredulous,
      helpless, frightened,&mdash;not a little ashamed. She was thinking more of
      the awful things those Moslem gentlemen would say about her should they
      come and discover her in Jaimihr's cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, sahiba! From end to end of India thy people are either dead, or
      else face to face with death. There is no escape anywhere for any man or
      woman&mdash;no hope, no chance. The British doom is sealed. So is the doom
      of every man who dared to side with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered. But she had to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be an army here within a day or two. My men&mdash;and I number
      them by thousands&mdash;will come and rip these Rangars from their roost.
      Those that are not crucified will be thrown down from the summit, and
      there shall be a Hindoo shrine where they have worshipped their false god.
      Then, sahiba, if thou art here&mdash;perhaps&mdash;there might&mdash;yet&mdash;be
      a way-perhaps, yes?&mdash;a way, still, to escape me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling. She could not help beginning to believe him. Whatever
      might be true of what he said was certainly not comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, while my army comes in search of me, my brother Howrah will be
      making merry with my palace and belongings. There will be devastation and
      other things in my army's rear for which there is no need and for which I
      have no stomach. I detest the thought of them, sahiba. Therefore, sahiba,
      I would drive a bargain. Notice, sahiba, I say not one word of love,
      though love such as mine is has seldom been offered to a woman. I say no
      word of love&mdash;as yet. I say, help me to escape by night, when I may
      make my way unseen back to my men: enable me to reach Howrah before my
      dear brother is aware of my trouble and before his men can start
      plundering, and name your own terms, sahiba!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Name her own terms&mdash;name her own terms&mdash;name her own terms! The
      words dinned through her head and she could grasp no other thought. She
      was alone in a cell with Jaimihr, and she could get out of it if she would
      name her terms! She must name them&mdash;she must hurry&mdash;what were
      they? What were her terms? She could not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand, sahiba. Certain things are sure. It is sure my men will come.
      It is sure that every Rangar on this rock will meet a very far from
      pleasant death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned, and though she could not see him grin, she knew that he was
      doing it. She knew that he was even then imagining a hundred horrors that
      the Rangars would endure before they died. She might name her terms. She
      could save them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she hissed hoarsely. &ldquo;No! They are my terms! I name them! You must
      spare them&mdash;spare the Rangars&mdash;spare every man on this hill, and
      theirs, and all they have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly are those thy terms, sahiba?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly! What others can I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are granted, sahiba!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he was speaking at least half the truth. She knew his power.
      She knew enough of Howrah City's politics to be convinced that he would
      not be left at the mercy of a little band of Rangars. She knew that there
      were not enough Rangars on the whole countryside to oppose the army that
      would surely come to his rescue. And whether he were dead or living, she
      knew well enough that the vengeance would be wreaked on every living body
      on the hill. Alwa might feel confident, not she. She trembled now with joy
      at the thought that she&mdash;she the most helpless and useless of all of
      them&mdash;might save the lives of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then another phase of the problem daunted her. She might help Jaimihr
      go. He might escape unobserved with her aid. But then? What then? What
      would the Rangars do to her? Had she sufficient courage to face that? It
      was not fear now that swept over her so much as wonder at herself. Jaimihr
      detected something different in her mental attitude, and, since almost any
      change means weakness to the Oriental mind, he was quick to try to take
      advantage of it. He guessed right at the first attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what wilt thou do here, sahiba? When I am gone, and there is none
      here to love thee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Peace! I have suffered enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt suffer more, should the Rangars learn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my business! Let me pass! I have bargained, and I will try to
      fulfil my part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped toward the door, but he held out both his arms and she saw
      them. She had no intention of being embraced by him, whatever their
      conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, sahiba! Listen! Escape with me! These Rangars will not believe
      without proof that thou hast saved their lives by bargaining. They will
      show thee short shrift indeed when my loss is discovered. Come now and I
      will make thee Maharanee in a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be as safe with one as with the other!&rdquo; she laughed, something of
      calm reflection returning to her. &ldquo;And what proof have I in any case that
      you will keep your word, Jaimihr-sahib. I will keep mine&mdash;but who
      will keep yours, that has been so often broken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me a proof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;now&mdash;in this place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convince me, if you can! I will give myself willingly if I can save my
      father by it and these Rangars and Mr. Cunningham; but your bare word,
      Jaimihr-sahib, is worth that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She snapped her fingers, and he swore beneath his breath. Then he
      remembered his ambition and his present need, and words raced to his aid&mdash;words,
      plans, oaths, treachery, and all the hundred and one tricks that he was
      used to. He found himself consciously selecting from a dozen different
      plans for tricking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke slowly and convincingly. In the gloom she could
      see his brown eyes levelled straight at hers, and she saw they did not
      flinch&mdash;&ldquo;there is none who knows better than thou knowest how my
      brother and I stand to each other.&rdquo; She shuddered at the reiterated second
      person singular, but he either did not notice it or else affected not to.
      &ldquo;Thou know est that there is no love between him and me, and that I would
      have his throne. The British could set me on that throne unless they were
      first overwhelmed. Wert thou my legal wife, and were I to aid the British
      in this minute of their need, they would not be overwhelmed, and afterward
      they would surely set me on the throne. Therefore I pledge my word to lead
      my men to the Company's aid, provided that these Rangars ride to my aid.
      My brother plans to overcome me first, and then take arms against the
      British. If the Rangars come to help me I will ride with them to the
      Company's aid afterward. That is my given word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the throne of Howrah is your price, Jaimihr-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art the price and the prize, sahiba! For thee I would win the
      throne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She actually laughed, and he winced palpably. There was no doubt that he
      loved her after a manner of his own, and her contempt hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said all I can say,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I have promised all I can
      promise. What more is there to say or offer? If I stay here, I swear on
      the honor of a Rajput and a prince of royal blood, that every living man
      and woman on this rock, excepting thee only, shall be dead within a week.
      But if I escape by thy aid, and if, at thy instance, these Rangars and
      their friends ride to my help against my brother, then I will throw all my
      weight&mdash;men and influence&mdash;in the scale on the British side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou shalt be Maharanee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in case that the British should be beaten before we reach them, then,
      sahiba! Then in case of thy need!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr-sahib, I will help you to escape tonight on the terms that you
      have named&mdash;that you spare these Rangars and every living body on
      this hill. Then I will do my utmost to persuade the Rangars to ride to
      your assistance on your condition, that you lead your men to help the
      British afterward. And if my action in helping you escape should make the
      Rangars turn against me and my immediate friends, I shall claim your
      protection. Is that agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba&mdash;absolutely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me pass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly he stood aside. She slipped out and let the bar down
      unobserved. But she had not recovered all her self-possession when she
      reached the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Miss McClean,&rdquo; said Cunningham; and she all but fainted, she was
      strained to such a pitch of nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you come from, Miss McClean?&rdquo; asked Cunningham. And she told
      him. She was not quite so stiff-chinned as she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him that, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his chair on the veranda, Mr. Cunningham. There, in that deep shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to him, please. I want your explanation in his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed as obediently as a child. The sense of guilt&mdash;of fright&mdash;of
      impending judgment left her as she walked with him, and gave place to a
      glow of comfort that here should be a man on whom to lean. She did not
      fight the new sensation, for she was growing strangely weary of the other
      one. By the time that they had reached her father, and he was standing
      before Cunningham wiping his spectacles in his nervous way, she had
      completely recovered her self-possession, although it is likely she would
      not have given any reason for it to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham held a lantern up, so that he could study both their faces. His
      own face muscles were set rigidly, and he questioned them as he might have
      cross-examined a spy caught in the act. His voice was uncompromising, and
      his manner stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you both understand how serious this situation is?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We naturally do,&rdquo; said Duncan McClean. The Scotsman was beginning to
      betray an inclination to bridle under the youngster's attitude, and to
      show an equally pronounced desire not to appear to. &ldquo;More so, probably,
      than anybody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you positive&mdash;both of you&mdash;you too, Mr. McClean&mdash;that
      all that talk about treasure in Howrah City is not mere imagination and
      legend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely positive!&rdquo; They both answered him at once, both looking in his
      eyes across the unsteady rays of the flickering, smoky lamp. &ldquo;The amount
      has been, of course, much exaggerated,&rdquo; said McClean, &ldquo;but I have no doubt
      there is enough there to pay the taxes of all India for a year or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have another question to ask. Do you both&mdash;or do you not&mdash;place
      yourselves at the service of the Company? It is likely to be dangerous&mdash;a
      desperate service. But the Company needs all that it can muster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we do!&rdquo; Again both answered in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand that that involves taking my orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Duncan McClean did the answering, and now it was he who seized
      the lamp. He held it high, and scanned Cunningham's face as though he were
      reading a finely drawn map.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are prepared&mdash;I speak for my daughter as well as for myself&mdash;to
      obey any orders that you have a right to give, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstand me,&rdquo; answered Cunningham. &ldquo;I am offering you the
      opportunity to serve the Company. As the Company's senior officer in the
      neighborhood, I am responsible to the Company for such orders as I see fit
      to give. I could not have my orders questioned. I don't mind telling you
      that I'm asking you, as British subjects, no more than I intend to ask
      Alwa and his Rangars. You can do as much as they are going to be asked to
      do. You can't do more. But you can do less if you like. You are being
      given the opportunity now to offer your services unconditionally&mdash;that
      is to say in the only manner in which I will accept them. Otherwise you
      will remain non-combatants, and I shall take such measures for your safety
      as I see fit. Time presses. Your answer, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will obey your legal orders,&rdquo; said McClean, still making full use of
      the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to admit the qualification,&rdquo; answered Cunningham promptly.
      &ldquo;Either you will obey, or you will not. You are asked to say which, that
      is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will obey,&rdquo; said Rosemary McClean quietly. She said it through straight
      lips and in a level voice that carried more assurance than a string of
      loud-voiced oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since my daughter sees fit to&mdash;ah&mdash;capitulate, I have no
      option.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good enough to be explicit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree to obey your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He seemed to have finished with McClean. He turned away from
      him and faced Rosemary, not troubling to examine her face closely as he
      had done her father's, but seeming none the less to give her full
      attention. &ldquo;I understood you to say that you promised to help Prince
      Jaimihr to escape from his cell tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duncan McClean could not have acted such amazement. Cunningham desired no
      further evidence that he had not been accessory to his daughter's visit to
      the prisoner. He silenced him with a gesture. And now his eyes seemed for
      the time being to have finished with both of them; in spite of the
      darkness they both knew that he had resumed the far-away look that seemed
      able to see things finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rosemary. &ldquo;I promised. I had to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father gasped. But Cunningham appeared to follow an unbroken chain of
      thought, and she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. You will both realize readily that we, as British subjects, are
      ranged all together on one side opposed to treachery, as represented by
      the large majority of the natives. That means that our first consideration
      must be to keep our given word. What we say,&mdash;what we promise&mdash;what
      we boast&mdash;must tally with what we undertake, and at the least try, to
      do. You must keep your word to Jaimihr, Miss McClean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared back at Cunningham through wide, unfrightened eyes. Whatever
      this man said to her, she seemed unable to feel fear while she had his
      attention. Her father seemed utterly bewildered, and she held his hand to
      reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the other hand, we cannot be guilty of a breach of faith to our friend
      Alwa here. I must have a little talk with him before I issue any orders.
      Please wait here and&mdash;ah&mdash;do nothing while I talk to Alwa. Did
      you&mdash;ah&mdash;did you agree to marry Jaimihr, should he make you
      Maharanee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I told him I would rather die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That makes matters easier. Now tell me over again from the
      beginning what you know about the political situation in Howrah. Quickly,
      please. Consider yourself a scout reporting to his officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Cunninham heard a commotion by the parapet, and stalked
      off to find Alwa, close followed by Mahommed Gunga. The grim old Rajput
      was grinning in his beard as he recognized the set of what might have been
      Cunningham the elder's shoulders.

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Ye may go and lay your praise
    At a shrine of other days
    By the tomb of him who gat, and her who bore me;
    My plan is good&mdash;my way&mdash;
    The sons of kings obey&mdash;
    But, I'm reaping where another sowed before me.
</pre>
    <p>
      JAIDEV SINGH was a five-K man, with the hair, breeches, bangle, comb, and
      dagger that betoken him who has sworn the vow of Khanda ka Pahul. Every
      item of the Sikh ritual was devised with no other motive than to preserve
      the fighting character of the organization. The very name Singh means
      lion. The Sikh's long hair with the iron ring hidden underneath is meant
      as a protection against sword-cuts. And because their faith is rather
      spiritual than fanatical&mdash;based rather on the cause of things than on
      material effect&mdash;men of that creed take first rank among fighting
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaidev Singh arrived soon after the moon had risen. The notice of his
      coming was the steady drumming footfall of his horse, that slowed
      occasionally, and responded to the spur again immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close to the big iron gate below Alwa's eyrie there were some of Jaimihr's
      cavalry nosing about among the trampled gardens for the dead and wounded
      they had left there earlier in the afternoon. They ceased searching, and
      formed up to intercept whoever it might be who rode in such a hurry. Above
      them, on the overhanging ramparts, there was quick discussion, and one man
      left his post hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horseman from the West!&rdquo; he announced, breaking in on Alwa's privacy
      without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us or them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa&mdash;glad enough of the relief from puzzling his brain&mdash;ran to
      the rampart and looked long at the moving dot that was coming noisily
      toward his fastness but that gave no sign of its identity or purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever he is can see them,&rdquo; he vowed. &ldquo;The moon shines full on them.
      Either he is a man of theirs or else a madman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched for five more minutes without speaking. Cunningham and Mahommed
      Gunga, coming out at last in search of him, saw the strained figures of
      the garrison peering downward through the yellow moon rays, and took stand
      on either side of him to gaze, too, in spellbound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is their man,&rdquo; said Alwa presently, &ldquo;he will turn now. He will
      change direction and ride for the main body of them yonder. He can see
      them now easily. Yes. See. He is their man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a horse that staggered gamely&mdash;silhouetted and beginning to show
      detail in the yellow light&mdash;a man whose nationality or caste could
      not be recognized rode straight for the bivouacking cavalry, and a swarm
      of them rode out at a walk to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension on the ramparts was relaxed then. As a friend in direst need
      the man would have been welcome. As one of enemy, with a message for them,
      however urgent, he was no more than an incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Allah!&rdquo; roared Alwa suddenly. &ldquo;That is no man of theirs! Quick! To the
      wheels! Man the wheels! Eight men to horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the cord himself, to send the necessary signal down into the belly
      of the rock. From his stables, where men and horses seemed to stand ready
      day and night, ten troopers cantered out, scattering the sparks, the
      whites of their horses' eyes and their drawn blades gleaming; without
      another order they dipped down the breakneck gorge, to wait below. The
      oncoming rider had wheeled again; he had caught the cavalry, that rode to
      meet him, unawares. They were not yet certain whether he was friend or
      foe, and they were milling in a bunch, shouting orders to one another. He,
      spurring like a maniac, was heading straight for the searching party, who
      had formed to cut him off. He seemed to have thrown his heart over Alwa's
      iron gate and to be thundering on hell's own horse in quest of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa's eight slipped down the defile as quickly as phantoms would have
      dared in that tricky moon-light. One of them shouted from below. Alwa
      jerked the cord, and the great gate yawned, well-oiled and silent. The
      oncomer raced straight for the middle of the intercepting line of
      horsemen; they&mdash;knowing him by this time for no friend&mdash;started
      to meet him; and Alwa's eight, unannounced and unexpected, whirled into
      them from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second there was shouting, blind confusion&mdash;eddying and trying
      to reform. The lone galloper pulled clear, and Alwa's men drove his
      opponents, crupper over headstall, into a body of the main contingent who
      had raced up in pursuit. They rammed the charge home, and reeled through
      both detachments&mdash;then wheeled at the spur and cut their way back
      again, catching up their man at the moment that his horse dropped dead
      beneath him. They seized him beneath the arms and bore him through as the
      great gate dropped and cut his horse in halves. Then one man took the
      galloper up behind his saddle, and bore him up the hill unquestioned until
      he could dismount in front of Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; demanded the owner of the rock, recognizing a warrior by
      his trademarks, but in no way moderating the natural gruffness of his
      voice. Alwa considered that his inviolable hospitality should be too well
      known and understood to call for any explanation or expression; he would
      have considered it an insult to the Sikh's intelligence to have mouthed a
      welcome; he let it go for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaidev Singh&mdash;galloper to Byng-bahadur. I bring a letter for the
      Risaldar Mahommed Gunga, or for Cunnigan-sahib, whichever I can find
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are both here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my letter is for both of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga each took one step forward, and the Sikh
      gave Cunningham a tiny, folded piece of paper, stuck together along one
      edge with native gum. He tore it open, read it in the light of a trooper's
      lantern, and then read it again aloud to Mahommed Gunga, pitching his
      voice high enough for Alwa to listen if he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you two men doing?&rdquo; ran the note. &ldquo;The very worst has happened.
      We all need men immediately, and I particularly need them. One hundred
      troopers now would be better than a thousand men a month from now. Hurry,
      and send word by bearer. S. F. BYNG.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon can you start back?&rdquo; asked Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minute I am provided with a horse, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham turned to Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be kind enough to feed him, Alwa-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa resented the imputation against his hospitality instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I was waiting for his money in advance!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Food waits,
      thou. Thou art a Sikh&mdash;thou eatest meat&mdash;meat, then, is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sikh, or at least the true Sikh, is not hampered by a list of caste
      restrictions. All of his precepts, taken singly or collectively, bid him
      be nothing but a man, and no law forbids him accept the hospitality of
      soldiers of another creed. So Jaidev Singh walked off to feed on curried
      beef that would have made a Hindoo know himself for damned. Cunningham
      then turned on Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now is the time, Alwa-sahib,&rdquo; he said in a level voice. &ldquo;My party can
      start off with this man and our answer, if your answer is no. If your
      answer is yes, then the Sikh can bear that answer for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would none of you ride half a mile alive!&rdquo; laughed Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I none the less require an answer, Alwa-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa stared hard at him. That was the kind of talk that went straight to
      his soldier heart. He loved a man who held to his point in the teeth of
      odds. The odds, it seemed to him, were awfully against Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was thy father,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;My cousin said thou wast thy
      father's son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require an answer by the time that the Sikh has finished eating,&rdquo; said
      Cunningham. &ldquo;Otherwise, Alwa-sabib, I shall regret the necessity of
      foregoing further hospitality at your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismillah! Am I servant here or master?&rdquo; wondered Alwa, loud enough for
      all his men to hear. Then he thought better of his dignity. &ldquo;Sahib,&rdquo; he
      insisted, &ldquo;I will not talk here before my men. We will have another
      conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I concede you ten minutes,&rdquo; said Cunningham, preparing to follow him, and
      followed in turn by Mohammed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, swore the Risaldar into his beard, we shall see the reaching of
      decisions! Now, by the curse of the sack of Chitor we shall know who is on
      whose side, or I am no Rangar, nor the son of one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a suggestion to make, sahib,&rdquo; smiled Alwa, closing the door of the
      rock-hewn chamber on the three of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear mine first!&rdquo; said Cunningham, with a hint of iron in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! Hear his first! Hear Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo; echoed Mahommed Gunga.
      &ldquo;Let us hear a plan worth hearing!&rdquo; And Alwa looked into a pair of steady
      eyes that seemed to see through him&mdash;past him&mdash;to the finished
      work beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I guarantee you shall! You shall not go to the Company's aid until
      you have satisfactory guarantees that your homes and friends will not be
      assailed behind your backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guarantees to whose satisfaction, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with whom am I dealing?&rdquo; Alwa seemed actually staggered. &ldquo;Who makes
      these promises? The Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my solemn word of honor on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least a man who speaks!&rdquo; swore Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the son of Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo; growled Mahommed Gunga, standing chin
      erect. He seemed in no doubt now of the outcome. He was merely waiting for
      it with soldierly and ill-concealed impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sahib&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alwa-sahib, we have no time for argument. It is yes or no. I must send an
      answer back by that Sikh. He must&mdash;he shall take my answer! Either
      you are loyal to our cause or you are not. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the breath of God, sahib, I am thinking you leave me little choice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still await an answer. I am calling on you for as many men as you can
      raise, and I have made you specific promises. Choose, Alwa-sahib. Yes or
      no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer is yes&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understand that you undertake to obey my orders without question
      until such time as a senior to me can be found to take over the command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is contingent on the agreement,&rdquo; hesitated Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like your word of honor, Alwa-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pledge that not lightly, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that very good reason I am asking for it. I shall know how far to
      trust when I have your word of honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew thy father! Thou art his son! I trusted him for good reason and
      with good result. I will trust thee also. My word is given, on thy
      conditions, sahib. First, the guarantees before we ride to the British
      aid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And you obey my orders?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My word is given, sahib. The oath of a Rajput, of a Rangar, of a
      soldier, of a zemindar of the House of Kachwaha; the oath of a man to a
      man, sahib; the promise of thy father's friend to thy father's son!
      Bahadur&rdquo;&mdash;he drew himself to his full height, and clicked his spurs
      together&mdash;&ldquo;I am thy servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham saluted. All three men looked in each other's eyes and a bond
      was sealed between them that nothing less than death could sever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Cunningham quite quietly. &ldquo;And now, Alwa-sahib&rdquo;&mdash;(he
      could strike while the iron glowed, could this son of Cunnigan!)&mdash;&ldquo;for
      the plan. There is little time. Jaimihr must escape tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, did I understand aright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa's jaw had actually dropped. He looked as though he had been struck.
      Mahommed Gunga slammed his sabre ferule on the stone floor. He too, was
      hard put to it to believe his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr is the key to the position. He is nothing but a nuisance where he
      is. Outside he can be made to help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I dreaming, or art thou, sahib?&rdquo; Alwa stood with fists clinched on his
      hips and his legs apart&mdash;incredulous. &ldquo;Jaimihr to go free? Why that
      Hindoo pig is the source of all the trouble in the district!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are neither of us dreaming, Alwa-sahib. Jaimihr is the dreamer. Let
      him dream in Howrah City for a day or two, while we get ready. Let him
      lead his men away and leave the road clear for us to pass in and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. He is your prisoner, and your honor is involved, and all that
      kind of thing. I'm offering you, to set off against that, a much greater
      honor than you ever experienced in your whole life yet, and I've put my
      order in the shape of a request for the sake of courtesy. I ask you again
      to let me arrange for Jaimihr to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was mad. But it seems that I have passed my word!&rdquo; swore Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you your word back again, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismillah! I refuse it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I do with Jaimihr as I like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave my word, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. You'll be glad before we've finished. Now I've left the raising
      of as many men as can be raised to you, Alwa-sahib. You will remember that
      you gave your promise on that count, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep that promise, too, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. You shall have a road clear by tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back a pace, awaited their salute with the calm, assured
      authority of a general of division, returned it, and left the two Rajputs
      looking in each other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, cousin, that thou hast brought me to?&rdquo; demanded Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga laughed and shook his sabre, letting it rattle in its
      scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This? This is the edge of the war that I promised thee a year ago! This
      is the service of which I spoke! This is the beginning of the
      blood-spilling! I have brought thee the leader of whom we spoke in Howrah
      City. Dost remember, cousin? I recall thy words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I recall them. I said then that I would follow a second Cunnigan,
      could such be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is he!&rdquo; vowed Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! But we Rangars have a leader! A man of men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this plan of his? This loosing of the trapped wolf&mdash;what of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither know nor care, as yet! I trust him! I am his man, as I was his
      father's! I have seen him; I have heard him; I have felt his pulse in the
      welter of the wrath of God. I know him. Whatever plans he makes, whatever
      way he leads, those are my plans, my road! I serve the son of Cunnigan!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Did he swear with his leg in a spring-steel trap
    And a tongue dry-cracked from thirst?
    Or down on his knees at his lady's lap
    With the lady's lips to his own, mayhap,
    And his head and his heart aburst?
    Nay! I have listened to vows enough
    And never the oath could bind
    Save that, that a free man chose to take
    For his own good reputation's sake!
    They're qualified&mdash;they're tricks&mdash;they break&mdash;
    They're words, the other kind!
</pre>
    <p>
      MAHOMMED GUNGA had long ago determined to &ldquo;go it blind&rdquo; on Cunningham. He
      had known him longest and had the greatest right. Rosemary McClean, who
      knew him almost least of all, so far as length of time was concerned, was
      ready now to trust him as far as the Risaldar dared go; her limit was as
      long and as devil-daring as Mahommed Gunga's. Whatever Scots reserve and
      caution may have acted as a brake on Duncan McClean's enthusiasm were
      offset by the fact that his word was given; so far as he was concerned, he
      was now as much and as obedient a servant of the Company as either of the
      others. Nor was his attitude astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alwa's was the point of view that was amazing, unexpected, brilliant,
      soldierly, unselfish&mdash;all the things, in fact, that no one had the
      least right to expect it to turn out to be. Two or three thousand men
      looked to him as their hereditary chieftain who alone could help them hold
      their chins high amid an overwhelming Hindoo population; his position was
      delicate, and he might have been excused for much hesitation, and even for
      a point-blank refusal to do what he might have preferred personally. He
      and his stood to lose all that they owned&mdash;their honor&mdash;and the
      honor of their wives and families, should they fight on the wrong side.
      Even as a soldier who had passed his word, he might have been excused for
      a lot of wordy questioning of orders, for he had enough at stake to make
      anybody cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, having said his say and sworn a dozen God-invoking Rangar oaths
      before he pledged his word, and then having pledged it, he threw Rajput
      tradition and the odds against him into one bottomless discard and
      proceeded to show Cunningham exactly what his fealty meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the boots and beard of Allah's Prophet!&rdquo; he swore, growing
      freer-tongued now that his liberty of action had been limited. &ldquo;Here we
      stand and talk like two old hags, Mahommed Gunga! My word is given. Let us
      find out now what this fledgling general of thine would have us do. If he
      is to release my prisoner, at least I would like to get amusement out of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he and Mahommed Gunga swaggered across the courtyard to where
      Cunningham had joined the McCleans again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We come with aid and not objections, sahib,&rdquo; he assured him. &ldquo;If we
      listen, it may save explanations afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So at a sign from Cunningham they enlarged the circle, and the East and
      West&mdash;bearded and clean-shaven, priest and soldiers, Christian and
      Mohammedan&mdash;stood in a ring, while almost the youngest of them&mdash;by
      far the youngest man of them&mdash;laid down the law for all. His eyes
      were all for Rosemary McClean, but his gestures included all of them, and
      they all answered him with nods or grunts as each saw fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for the Sikh!&rdquo; commanded Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, with a lump of native bread still in his fist, Jaidev
      Singh walked up and saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Byng-bahadur now?&rdquo; asked Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Deeseera, sahib&mdash;not shut in altogether, but hard pressed. There
      came cholera, and Byng-bahadur camped outside the town. He has been
      striking, sahib, striking hard with all too few to help him. His
      irregulars, sahib, were disbanded at some one's orders just before this
      outbreak, but some of them came back at word from him. And there were some
      of us Sikhs who knew him, and who would rather serve him and die than
      fight against him and live. He has now two British regiments with him,
      sadly thinned&mdash;some of my people, some Goorkhas, some men from the
      North&mdash;not very many more than two thousand men all told, having lost
      heavily in action and by disease. But word is going round from mouth to
      mouth that many sahibs have been superseded, and that only real sahibs
      such as Byng-bahadur have commands in this hour. Byng-bahadur is a man of
      men. We who are with him begin to have courage in our bones again. Is the
      answer ready? Yet a little while? It is well, sahib, I will rest. Salaam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Cunningham, &ldquo;the situation's desperate. We've got to act.
      Alwa here stands pledged to protect Howrah and you have promised to aid
      Jaimihr. Somebody's word has got to break, and you may take it from me
      that it will be the word of the weakest man! I think that that man is
      Jaimihr, but I can't be sure in advance, and we've got to accept his
      promise to begin with. Go to him, Miss McClean, and make a very careful
      bargain with him along the line I mapped out for you. Alwa-sahib, I want
      witnesses, or rather overhearers. I want you and Mahommed Gunga to place
      yourselves near Jaimihr's cell so that you can hear what he says. There
      won't be any doubt then about who has broken promises. Are you ready, Miss
      McClean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling, but from excitement and not fear. Both Rajputs saluted
      her as she started back for the cell, and whatever their Mohammedan ideas
      on women may have been, they chose to honor this one, who was so evidently
      one of them in the hour of danger. Duncan McClean seemed to be praying
      softly, for his lips moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cell-door creaked open, Alwa and Mahommed Gunga were crouched one
      on either side, listening with the ears of soldiers that do not let many
      sounds or words escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr-sahib!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Jaimihr-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Sahiba!&rdquo; Then he called her by half a dozen names that made the
      listening Rangars grin into their beards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr-sahib&rdquo;&mdash;she raised her voice a little now&mdash;&ldquo;if I help
      you to escape, will you promise me my safety under all conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahiba!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you swear to protect every living person on this hill, including the
      Alwa-sahib and Cunningham-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahiba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it on my honor. There is no more sacred oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, listen. I can help you to escape now. I have a rope that is long
      enough to lower you over the parapet. I am prepared to risk the
      consequences, but I want to bargain with you for aid for my Countrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alwa-sahib and his Rangars stand pledged to help your brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed at least that much,&rdquo; laughed Jaimihr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would not help you against him under any circumstances. But they
      want to ride to the Company's aid, and they might be prepared to protect
      you against him. They might guarantee the safety of your palace and your
      men's homes. They might exact a guarantee from Howrah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr laughed aloud, careless of the risk of being overheard, and
      Rosemary knew that Cunningham's little plan was useless even before it had
      been quite expounded. She felt herself trembling for the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba, there is only one condition that would make me ride to the
      British aid with all my men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, Jaimihr-sahib,&rdquo; she whispered, understanding all
      too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me. Come to me in Howrah. Then whatever these fool Rangars choose
      to do, I swear by Siva and the Rites of Siva that I will hurry to the
      Company's aid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary McClean shuddered, and he knew it. But that fact rather added to
      his pleasure. The wolf prefers a cowering, frightened prey even though he
      dare fight on occasion. She was thinking against time. Through that one
      small, overburdened head, besides a splitting headache, there was flashing
      the ghastly thought of what was happening to her countrymen and women&mdash;of
      what would happen unless she hurried to do something for their aid. All
      the burden of all warring India seemed to be resting on her shoulders, in
      a stifling cell; and Jaimihr seemed to be the only help in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men could you summon to the Company's aid?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;Ten thousand!&rdquo; he boasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armed and drilled men&mdash;soldiers fit to fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is a lie, Jaimihr-sahib. There is not time enough to waste
      on lies. Tell me the exact truth, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He contrived to save his face, or, rather, he contrived to make himself
      believe he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would need some to guard my rear,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I could lead five
      thousand to the British aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor, sahiba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wish to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahiba&mdash;I&mdash;I have no other wish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree to marry you provided you will lead five thousand men to the
      Company's aid, but not until you have done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to Howrah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could feel his excitement. The cell walls seemed to throb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I shall come accompanied by my father, and Mr. Cunningham, and
      all the Rangars he can raise. And I shall hold you to your bargain. You
      must help the Company first. FIRST&mdash;d'you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Jaimihr's turn now to lay the law down. She had let him see her
      eagerness to gain his aid for the Company, and he saw the weakness of her
      case in an instant. He knew very well, too, that no woman of her breed
      would have thought of consenting to marry him unless her hand was forced.
      He decided immediately to force it further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sahiba. I, too, will hold thee to thy promise! Thou wilt
      come with an escort, as befits a prince's wife! But how should I know that
      the Rangars would prove friends of mine? How should I know that it is not
      all a trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have my promise to depend on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly! And there will be how many hundred men to override the promise of
      one woman? Nay! My word is good; my promise holds; but on my own
      conditions! Help me to escape. Then follow me to Howrah City. Come in
      advance of thy Rangar escort. By that I will know that the Rangars and
      this Cunningham are my friends&mdash;otherwise they would not let thee
      come. The Rangars are to exact guarantees from my brother? How should I
      know that they do not come to help my brother crush me out of existence?
      With thee in my camp as hostage I would risk agreement with them, but not
      otherwise. Escape with me now, or follow. But bring no Rangars, sahiba!
      Come alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not. I would not dare trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr laughed. &ldquo;I have been reckoning, sahiba, how many hours will pass
      before my army comes to rip this nest of Alwa's from its roots, and defile
      the whole of it! If I am to spare the people on this rock, then I must
      hurry! Should my men come here to carry me away, they will be less
      merciful than I! Choose, sahiba! Let me go, and I will spare these Rangars
      until such time as they earn punishment anew. Or let me go, and follow me.
      Then fight with the Rangars and for the Company, with thee as the price of
      my alliance. Or leave me in this cell until my men come to rescue me. The
      last would be the simplest way! Or it would be enough to help me escape
      and wait until I have done my share at conquering the British. Then I
      could come and claim thee! Choose, sahiba; there are many ways, though
      they all end in one goal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am the price of your allegiance,&rdquo; said Rosemary, &ldquo;then I will pay
      the price. Five thousand men for the British cause are dearer to me than
      my own happiness. I promise, Jaimihr-sahib, that I will come to you in
      Howrah. I shall come accompanied by one servant, named Joanna, and&mdash;I
      think&mdash;by my father; and the Rangars and Mr. Cunningham shall be at
      least a day's ride behind me. I give my word on that. But&mdash;I can
      promise you, on Mr. Cunningham's behalf, and on the Alwa-sahib's, and
      Mahommed Gunga's, that should you have made any attempt against my liberty&mdash;should
      you have offered me any insult or indignity&mdash;before they come&mdash;should
      you have tried to anticipate the terms of your agreement&mdash;then&mdash;then&mdash;there
      would be an end of bargaining and promises, Jaimihr-sahib, and your life
      would be surely forfeit! Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahiba!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I already have agreed. They are my terms. I named them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to hear you promise, on your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear by all my gods and by my honor. I swear by my love, that is
      dearer to me than a throne, and by the name and the honor of a Rajput!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ready, then. I am going now to hide the rope in the shadow of the
      wall. It will take perhaps fifteen minutes. Be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a quick movement to embrace her, but she slipped out and escaped
      him; and he thought better of his sudden plan to follow her, remembering
      that her word was likely to be good, whatever his might be. He elected to
      wait inside until she returned for him. He little knew that he missed the
      downward swing of Alwa's sabre, that was waiting, poised and balanced for
      him, in the darkness by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismillah! I would have had a right to kill him had he followed her and
      broken faith so early in the business!&rdquo; Alwa swore, excusing his
      impatience to Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Have no fear, sahib!&rdquo; he counselled
      Cunningham a moment later, laying a heavy hand on the boy's arm. &ldquo;Let her
      keep her promises. That Hindoo pig will not keep his! We will be after
      her, and surely&mdash;surely we will find good cause for some
      throat-slitting as well as the cancelling of marriage promises!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand, Alwa-sahib, that&mdash;if Jaimihr keeps his promise to
      her, she must keep hers to him? Do you realize that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allah! Listen to him! Yes, sahib. Truly, bahadur, I appreciate! I also
      know that I have given certain promises which I, too, must fulfil! She is
      not the only bargainer! I am worrying more about those guarantees that
      Howrah was to give&mdash;I am anxious to see how, with fifteen hundred, we
      are to get the better of a Rajah and his brother and their total of ten
      thousand! I want to see those promises performed! Ay! The Miss-sahib has
      done well. She has done her share. Let her continue. And do thou thy
      share, bahadur! I am at thy back with my men, but give us action!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham held up a lantern, and looked straight at Duncan McClean. The
      missionary had held his daughter's hand while she recounted what had
      happened in the cell. Whatever he may have thought, he had uttered no word
      of remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we go to Howrah ahead of you,&rdquo; he answered to Cunningham's
      unspoken question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham held out his right hand, and the missionary shook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold the lamp, please,&rdquo; said Cunningham, and Mahommed Gunga seized it.
      Then Cunningham took paper and a pencil and read aloud the answer that he
      wrote to Byng-bahadur. He wrote it in Greek characters for fear lest it
      might fall into the enemy's hands and be too well understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be with you in one week, sir, and perhaps sooner. Unless we are all
      killed in the meantime we should number more than fifteen hundred when we
      come. Expect either all or none of us. The situation here is critical, but
      our course seems clear, and we ought to pull through. Mahommed Gunga sends
      salaams. Your obedient servant,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        &ldquo;RALPH CUNNINGHAM.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would God I could see the clear course!&rdquo; laughed Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the Sikh, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sikh came running, and Cunningham gave him the folded note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a horse for him, Alwa-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has been attended to, sahib,&rdquo; the Sikh answered. &ldquo;The Alwa-sahib has
      given me a wonder of a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Jaidev Singh. Watch your chance. Go to the parapet, and
      when you see by their lanterns that the cavalry below have ridden off,
      then race for all you're worth with that news for Byng-bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, sahib!&rdquo; said the Sikh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, Jaidev Singh. And now hide, every-body! Don't let Jaimihr get the
      impression that we're playing with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later Miss McClean led Jaimihr through a passage in the rock, off
      which axe-hewn cells led on either side, to the far side of the summit,
      where the parapet was higher but the wall was very much less sheer. The
      Prince's arms were still too sore from the wrenching he received when they
      took him prisoner for him to dare trust himself hand over hand on a rope;
      she had to make the rope fast beneath his armpits, and then lower him
      slowly, taking two turns with the rope round the waist of a brass cannon.
      The Prince fended himself off the ragged wall with hands and feet, and
      called up instructions to her as loudly as he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tremendous drop. For the last fifty or more feet the wall rose
      straight, overhung by a ridge that rasped the rope. And the rope proved
      fifteen feet or more too short. Rosemary paid out as much of it as she
      dared, and then made the end fast round the cannon, leaning over to see
      whether Jaimihr would have sense enough or skill enough to cut himself
      free and fall. But he hung where he was and spun, and it was five minutes
      before Rosemary remembered that his weapons had all been taken from him!
      It was scarcely likely that he could bite the thick rope through with his
      teeth!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood then for two or three more minutes wondering what to do, for she
      had no knife of her own, and she had made the rope fast&mdash;woman-wise&mdash;with
      a true landlubber's knot that tightened from the strain until her
      struggling fingers could not make the least impression on it. But Alwa
      walked up openly&mdash;drew his heavy sabre&mdash;and saved the situation
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may help to jog his recollection of the bargain!&rdquo; he laughed,
      severing the rope with a swinging cut and peering over to see, if he
      could, how Jaimihr landed. By a miracle the Prince landed on his feet. He
      sat down for a moment to recover from the shock, and then walked off
      awkwardly to where his cavalry were sleeping by their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had some trouble in persuading the outposts who he really was, and
      there was an argument that could be quite distinctly heard from the summit
      of the rock, and made Alwa roar with laughter before, finally, the whole
      contingent formed and wheeled and moved away, ambling toward Howrah City
      at a pace that betokened no unwillingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the Sikh's horse thundered out across the plain from
      under Alwa's iron gate, and the news, such as it was, was on its way to
      Byng-bahadur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clear road at the price of a horse-hide rope!&rdquo; laughed Alwa. &ldquo;Now for
      some real man's work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary stole off to argue with her father and her conscience, but Alwa
      went to his troopers' quarters and told off ten good men for the task of
      manning the fortress in his absence. They were ten unwilling men; it
      needed all his gruff authority, and now and then a threat, to make them
      stay behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave ten men behind,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;It takes four men, even at a
      pinch, to lift the gate. And who shall guard my women? Nay, I should leave
      twenty, and I must leave ten. Therefore I leave the ten best men I have,
      and they who stay behind may know by that that I consider them the best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of his troopers he sent out one by one in different
      directions, with orders to rally every Rangar they could find, and at a
      certain point he named. Then he and Mahommed Gunga said good-by to
      Cunningham and took a trail that led in the direction where most of the
      doubtfuls lived&mdash;the men who might need personal convincing&mdash;rousing&mdash;awakening
      from lethargy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I ought to stay behind?&rdquo; asked Cunningham, who had already made
      his mind up but chose to consult Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahib. If for no other reason, then to make sure that that priest
      of thine and his daughter make tracks for Howrah City! While he is here he
      is a priest, and we Rangars have our own ideas on what they are good for!
      When he is there he will be a man maneuvering to save his own life and his
      daughter's reputation! See that he starts, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rode off then. But before Mahommed Gunga saw fit to follow him he
      legged his charger close to Cunningham for a final word or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear now, bahadur&mdash;no anxiety! Three days hence there will
      be a finer regiment to lead than ever thundered in thy father's wake&mdash;a
      regiment of men, sahib, for a man to lead and love!&mdash;a regiment that
      will trust thee, sahib! See thou to the guarantees! Rung Ho, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rung Ho! See you again, Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo;

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Sabres and spurs and jingling bits&mdash;
            (Ho!  But the food to feed them!)
    Sinews and eyes and ears and wits&mdash;
            (Hey!  But the troopers need them!)
    Sahib, mount!  Thy chargers fling
    Foam to the night&mdash;thy trumpets sing&mdash;
    Thy lance-butts on the stirrups ring&mdash;
            Mount, sahib!  Blood them!  Lead them!
</pre>
    <p>
      IT was arranged that the McCleans, with old Joanna, should start at dawn
      for Howrah City, and they were, both of them, too overcome with mingled
      dread and excitement to even try to sleep. Joanna, very much as usual,
      snoozed comfortably, curled in a blanket in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would run about a hundred different risks, not least of which was the
      chance of falling in with a party of Howrah's men. In fact, if they should
      encounter anybody before bringing up at Jaimihr's palace it was likely
      that the whole plan would fizzle into nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, after fossicking for a long time in Aliva's armory&mdash;that
      contained, besides weapons of the date, a motley assortment of the tools
      of war that would have done great credit to a museum of antiquities&mdash;produced
      two pistols. He handed, one to the missionary and one to Miss McClean,
      advising her to hide hers underneath her clothing. &ldquo;You know what they're
      for?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;No. You'd gain nothing by putting up a fight. They're
      loaded. All you've got to do is jerk the hammer back and pull the trigger,
      and the best way not to miss is to hold the muzzle underneath your chin&mdash;this
      way&mdash;keeping the butt well out from you. You make sure when you do
      that. The only satisfaction you'll have, if it comes to suicide as a last
      resource, will be that you've tried to do your duty and the knowledge that
      you'll be avenged. I promise that. But I don't think you'll have any need
      to do it&mdash;if I did think it I'd have thought twice before sending
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does such a very young man as you come to have all this
      responsibility?&rdquo; asked Rosemary, taking the pistol without a shudder. She
      laughed then as she noticed Cunningham's discomfort and recognized the
      decency that hates to talk about itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I know my own mind,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;These other awfully decent
      fellows don't, that's all&mdash;if you except Mahommed Gunga. That chap's
      a wonder. 'Pon my soul, it seems he knew this was coming and picked me
      from the start to take charge over here. Seems, owing to my dad's
      reputation, these Rangars think me a sort of reincarnation of efficiency.
      I've got to try and live up to it, you know&mdash;same old game of reaping
      what you didn't sow and hoping it'll all be over before you wake up! Won't
      you try and get some sleep before morning? No? Come and sit over by the
      parapet with me, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carried chairs for both of them to a point whence he could sit and
      watch the track that led to Howrah and so help out the very meagre
      garrison. There, until the waning moon dipped down below the sky-line,
      they talked together&mdash;first about the task ahead of each of them;
      then about the sudden ghastliness of the rebellion, whose extent not one
      of them could really grasp as yet; last, and much longest, as familiarity
      gradually grew between them, of youthful reminiscences and home&mdash;of
      Eton and the Isle of Skye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness and the comparative coolness that came between the setting
      of the moon and dawn Rosemary fell asleep, her head pillowed in her
      father's lap. For a while, then, seeing her only dimly through the night,
      but conscious, as he could not help being, of her youth and charm and of
      the act of self-sacrifice that she had undertaken without remonstrance, he
      felt ashamed. He began to wonder whether there might not have been some
      other way&mdash;whether he had any right, even for his country's sake, to
      send a girl on such a mission. Misgiving began to sap his optimism, and
      there was no Mahommed Gunga to stir the soldier in him and encourage
      iron-willed pursuance of the game. He began to doubt; and doubt bred
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wakened from a revery by Duncan McClean, who raised his daughter
      tenderly and got up on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dawn will be here soon, Mr. Cunningham. We had better get ready. Well&mdash;in
      case we never meet again&mdash;I'm glad I met you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better start before the sun gets up,&rdquo; he answered, gripping the
      missionary's hand. He was a soldier again. He had had the answer to his
      thoughts! If the man who was to sacrifice his daughter&mdash;or risk her
      sacrifice&mdash;was pleased to have met him, there was not much sense in
      harboring self-criticism! He shook it off, and squared his shoulders,
      beginning again to think of all that lay ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust to the old woman to guide you and show you a place to rest at, if
      you must rest. You ought to reach Howrah at dusk tomorrow, for you'll find
      it quite impossible to travel fast&mdash;you're both of you too stiff, for
      one thing. Lie up somewhere&mdash;Joanna will know of a place&mdash;until
      the old woman has taken in a message to Jaimihr, and wait until he sends
      you some men to escort you through the outskirts of the city. I've got
      disguises ready for you&mdash;a pugree for you, Mr. McClean, and a purdah
      for your daughter&mdash;you'll travel as a Hindoo merchant and his wife.
      If you get stopped, say very little, but show this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced the letter written once by Maharajah Howrah to the Alwa-sahib
      and sent by galloper with the present of a horse. It was signed, and at
      the bottom of it was the huge red royal seal. &ldquo;Now go and put the disguise
      on, while I see to the horses; I'm going to pick out quiet ones, if
      possible, though I warn you they're rare in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some twenty minutes later he led their horses for them gingerly down the
      slippery rock gorge, and waited at the bottom while six men wound the gate
      up slowly. Rosemary McClean was quite unrecognizable, draped from head to
      foot in a travelling veil that might have been Mohammedan or Hindoo, and
      gave no outward sign as to her caste, or rank. McClean, in the full attire
      of a fairly prosperous Hindoo, but with no other mark about him to betoken
      that he might be worth robbing, rode in front of her, high-perched on a
      native saddle. In front, on a desert pony, rode Joanna, garbed as a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to be travelling in a carriage of some kind,&rdquo; admitted
      Cunningham, &ldquo;but we haven't got a single wheeled thing here. If any one
      asks pertinent questions on the road, you'd better say that she had an
      ekka, but that some Rangars took it from you. D'you think you know the
      language well enough to pass muster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a little late to ask me that!&rdquo; laughed McClean. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I'm
      positive I do. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands again and the three rode off, cantering presently, to
      make the most of the coolness before the sun got up. Cunningham climbed
      slowly up the hill and then watched them from the parapet&mdash;wondering,
      wondering again&mdash;whether he was justified. As he put it to himself,
      it was &ldquo;the hell of a position for a man to find himself in!&rdquo; He caught
      himself wondering whether his thoughts would have been the same, and
      whether his conscience would have racked him quite as much, had Rosemary
      McClean been older, and less lovely, and a little more sour-tongued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to laugh presently at the absurdity of that notion, for Jaimihr
      would never have bargained for possession of a sour-faced, elderly woman.
      He came to the conclusion that the only thing he could do was to
      congratulate the Raj because, at the right minute, the right good-looking
      woman had been on the spot! But he did not like the circumstances any
      better; and before two hours had passed the loneliness began to eat into
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any other man whose race and breed and training make him
      self-dependent, he could be alone for weeks on end and scarcely be aware
      that he had nobody to talk to. But his training had never yet included
      sending women off on dangerous missions any more than it had taught him to
      resist woman's attraction&mdash;the charm of a woman's voice, the lure of
      a woman's eyes. He did not know what was the matter with him, but supposed
      that his liver must be out of order or else that the sun had touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a chance on the liver diagnosis, he had out the attenuated
      garrison, and drilled it, both mounted and dismounted, first on the
      hilltop&mdash;where they made the walls re-echo to the clang of grounded
      butts&mdash;and then on the plain below, with the gate wide open in their
      rear and one man watching from the height above. When he had tired them
      thoroughly, and himself as well, he set two men on the lookout and retired
      to sleep; nor did the droning and the wailing music of some women in the
      harem trouble him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called him regularly when the guard was changed, but he slept the
      greater part of that day and stood watch all night. The next day, and the
      third day, he drilled the garrison again, growing horribly impatient and
      hourly more worried as to what Byng-bahadur might be doing, and thinking
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening of the fourth day when a Rangar woke him, squeezing at his
      foot and standing silent by the cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huzoor&mdash;Mahommed Gunga comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran to the parapet and watched in the fading light a little dust cloud
      that followed no visible track but headed straight toward them over
      desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you know that's Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else, huzoor? Who else would ride from that direction all alone and
      straight for this nest of wasps? Who else but Alwa or Mahommed Gunga? Alwa
      said he would not come, but would wait yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be one of Alwa's men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have many good men, sahib&mdash;and many good horses&mdash;but no man
      or horse who could come at that pace after traversing those leagues of
      desert! That is Mahommed Gunga, unless a new fire-eater has been found.
      And what new man would know the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon&mdash;staccato, like a drum-beat in the silence&mdash;came the
      welcome, thrilling cadence of the horse's hoofs&mdash;the steady thunder
      of a horse hard-ridden but not foundered. The sun went down and blackness
      supervened, but the sound increased, as one lone rider raced with the
      evening wind, head on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed like an hour before the lookout challenged from the crag that
      overhung the gate&mdash;before the would-be English words rang out; and
      all Asia and its jackals seemed to wait in silence for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howt-uh! Hukkums-thar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&mdash;hommed&mdash;Gunga&mdash;hai!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheer broke bonds from the depth of Cunningham's being, and Mahommed
      Gunga heard it on the plain below. There was a rush to man the wheels and
      sweat the gate up, and Cunningham started to run down the zigzag pathway.
      He thought better of it, though, and waited where the path gave out onto
      the courtyard, giving the signal with the cords for the gate to lower away
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo; he said, almost casually, as the weary
      charger's nose appeared above the rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted and saluted and then leaned against his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, sahib, whether the horse or I be weariest! Of your favor,
      water, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham brought him water in a dipper, and the Rajput washed his
      horse's mouth out, then held out the dipper again to Cunningham for fresh
      charge for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not ask the service, sahib, but for the moment my head reels. I
      must rest before I ride again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well, Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sahib! More than well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men are ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horsed, armed, and waiting, they keep coming&mdash;there were many when I
      left&mdash;there will be three squadrons worthy of the name by the time we
      get there! Is all well at your end, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all's well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the padre people go to Howrah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They started and they have not returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Allah be praised! Inshallah, I will grip that spectacled old woman
      of a priest by the hand before I die. He has a spark of manhood in him!
      Send me this good horse to the stables, sahib; I am overweary. Have him
      watered when the heat has left him, and then fed. Let them blanket him
      lightly. And, sahib, have his legs rubbed&mdash;that horse ever loved to
      have his legs rubbed. Allah! I must sleep four hours before I ride! And
      the Miss-sahib&mdash;went she bravely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went as a woman of her race ought to go, Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! She met a man first of her own race, and he made her go! Would she
      have gone if a coward asked her, think you? Sahib&mdash;women are good&mdash;at
      the other end of things! We will ride and fetch her. Ha! I saw! My eyes
      are old, but they bear witness yet!&mdash;Now, food, sahib&mdash;for the
      love of Allah, food, before my belt-plate and my backbone touch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what the damned old infidel is dreaming of!&rdquo; swore Cunningham,
      as Mahommed Gunga staggered to the chamber in the rock where a serving-man
      was already heaping victuals for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have me called in four hours, sahib! In four hours I will be a man
      again!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    The freed wolf limped home to his lair,
    And lay to lick his sore.
    With wrinkled lip and fangs agnash&mdash;
    With back-laid ear and eyes aflash&mdash;
    &ldquo;Twas something rather more than rash
    To turn me loose!&rdquo; he swore.
</pre>
    <p>
      NOW Jaimihr fondly thought he held a few cards up his sleeve when he made
      his bargain with Rosemary McClean and let himself be lowered from the
      Alwa-sahib's rock. He knew, better probably than any one except his
      brother and the priests, how desperate the British situation had become
      throughout all India at an instant's notice, and he made his terms
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not believe, in the first place, that there would be any British
      left to succor by the time matters had been settled sufficiently in Howrah
      to enable him to dare leave the city at his rear. Afterward, should it
      seem wise, he would have no objection in the world to riding to the aid of
      a Company that no longer existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, he entertained no least compunction about breaking
      his word completely in every particular. He knew that the members of the
      little band on Alwa's rock would keep their individual and collective
      word, and therefore that Rosemary McClean would come to him. He suspected,
      though, that there would prove to be a rider of some sort to her agreement
      as regarded marrying him, for he had young Cunningham in mind; and he knew
      enough of Englishmen from hearsay and deduction to guess that Cunningham
      would interject any obstacle his ingenuity could devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natives of India do not like Englishmen to marry their women. How much
      less, then, would a stiff-necked member of a race of conquerors care to
      stand by while a woman of his own race became the wife of a native prince?
      He did not trust Cunningham, and he recalled that he had had no promise
      from that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, he proposed to forestall Cunningham if possible, and, if that
      were inconvenient or rash, he meant to take other means of making Rosemary
      McClean his, beyond dispute, in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to Rosemary McClean he coveted most the throne of Howrah. With regard
      to that he was shrewd enough not to conceal from himself for a second the
      necessity for scotching the priests of Siva before he dare broach the
      Howrah treasure, and so make the throne worth his royal while. Nor did he
      omit from his calculations the public clamor that would probably be raised
      should he deal too roughly with the priests. And he intended to deal
      roughly with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the proposed allegiance of the Rangars suited him in more ways than
      one. His army and his brother's were so evenly matched in numbers and
      equipment that he had been able to leave Howrah without fear for the
      safety of his palace while his back was turned. The eight hundred whom he
      had led on the unlucky forray to Alwa's were scarcely missed, and, even
      had the Maharajah known that he was absent with them, there were still too
      many men behind for him to dare to start reprisals. The Maharajah was too
      complete a coward to do anything much until he was forced into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rangars, he resolved, must be made to take the blame for the broaching
      of the treasure. He proposed to go about the broaching even before
      hostilities between himself and his brother had commenced, and he expected
      to be able to trick the Rangars into seeming to be looting. To appear to
      defend the treasure would probably not be difficult; and it would be even
      less difficult to blame the Rangars afterward for the death of any priest
      who might succumb during the ensuing struggle. He counted on the populace,
      more than on his own organized forces, to make the Rangars powerless when
      the time should come for them to try to take the upper hand. The mob would
      suffer in the process, but its fanaticism&mdash;its religious prejudice
      and numbers&mdash;would surely win the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Rosemary McClean, the more he considered her the more his brown
      eyes glowed. He had promised to make her Maharanee. But he knew too
      thoroughly what that would mean not to entertain more than a passing doubt
      as to the wisdom of the course. He was as ready to break his word on that
      point as on any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman of his own race, however wooed and won, would have been content to
      accept the usual status of whisperer from behind the close-meshed screens.
      Not so an Englishwoman, with no friends to keep her company and with
      nothing in the world to do but think. She, he realized, would expect to
      make something definite of her position, and that would suit neither his
      creed (which was altogether superficial), nor custom (which was iron-bound
      and to be feared), nor prejudice (which was prodigious), nor yet
      convenience (which counted most).
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the conclusion that the fate in store for her was not such as
      she would have selected had she had her choice. Nor were his conclusions
      in regard to her such as would commend him in the eyes of honest men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, the throne was the fulcrum of his plotting; and the lever
      had to be the treasure, if his plans were to succeed beyond upsetting. He
      changed his plans a dozen times over before he arrived at last at the
      audacious decision he was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many another Hindoo in that hour of England's need, he did not lose
      sight altogether of the distant if actual possibility that the Company's
      servants might&mdash;by dint of luck and grit, and what the insurance
      papers term the Act of God&mdash;pull through the crisis. Therefore, he
      decided that under no circumstances should Rosemary McClean be treated
      cavalierly until the Rangars were out of the way and he could pose as her
      protector if need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be able to prove that Rosemary and her father had come to him of
      their own free will. He would say that they had asked him for protection
      from the Rangars. He had evidence that his brother Howrah had been in
      communication with the Rangars. So, should the Company survive and retain
      power enough to force an answer to unpleasant questions, he thought it
      would not be difficult to prove that he had been the Company's friend all
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all the circumstances he considered it best to be false to everybody
      and strike for no hand but his own, and with that reconsidered end in view
      he decided on a master-stroke. He sent word to his brother, the Maharajah,
      saying that the Rangars had accepted service with the Company and purposed
      a raid on Howrah; therefore, he proposed that they unite against the
      common enemy and set a trap for the Rangars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howrah sent back to ask what proof he had of the Rangars' taking service
      with the British. Jaimihr answered that Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga were
      both on Alwa's crag. He also swore that as Alwa's prisoner he had been
      able to over-hear the Rangars' plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Maharajah was bewildered, as Jaimihr had expected that he would be.
      And with just as Eastern, just as muddle-headed, just as dishonest
      reasoning, he made up his mind to play a double game with everybody, too.
      He agreed to join Jaimihr in opposition to the Rangars. He agreed to send
      all his forces to meet Jaimihr's and together kill every Rangar who should
      show himself inside the city. And he privately made plans to arrive on the
      scene too late, and smash Jaimihr's army after it had been reduced in size
      and efficiency by its battle with Alwa's men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr, unknowingly, fitted his plan into his brother's by determining to
      get on the scene early enough to have first crack at the treasure. He
      meant to get away with that, leave his brother to deal with Alwa's men,
      circle round, and then attack his brother from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he made up his mind once and for all that Rosemary McClean must
      remain inviolate until he was quite certain that the English had been
      driven out of India. He expected that good news within a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted when Joanna, dressed as a man, turned up at his
      palace-gates and cajoled her way in past the guards. To be asked for an
      escort to bring the McCleans into Howrah fitted in with his role of
      protector as a key might fit a lock. Now they could never pretend&mdash;nobody
      could ever pretend&mdash;that he had seized them. He sent a carriage out
      for them, and when they arrived placed a whole wing of his palace at their
      disposal, treating them like royalty. He made no attempt to molest or
      interfere with either of them, except that he prevented them from going in
      and out; and he told off plenty of witnesses who would be able to swear
      subsequently that they had seen how well his guests were treated. He was
      taking no unnecessary chances at that stage of the game he played.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others, though, who plotted besides Jaimihr. There were, for
      instance, Siva's priests. It is not to be forgotten that in that part of
      India the priests had been foremost in fomenting the rebellion. They urged
      Howrah constantly to take the field against the British, and it was only
      the sure knowledge of his brother's intention to strike for the throne
      that prevented the Maharajah from doing what the priests urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that Alwa and the Rangars would not help him unless Jaimihr first
      attacked him, for Alwa would be sure to stand on the strict letter of his
      oath. And he was afraid of the Rangars. He feared that they might protect
      him and depose him afterward. He reasoned that that, too, might be
      construed into a strict interpretation of the terms of Alwa's promise!
    </p>
    <p>
      He consented to collect his army. He kept it under arms. He even paid it
      something on account of arrears of wages and served out rations. But, to
      the disgust of the priests who asked nothing better than dissension
      between the brothers, he jumped at the idea of uniting with Jaimihr to
      defeat Alwa's men. He knew&mdash;just as the priests feared&mdash;that
      once he could trick and defeat Jaimihr he could treat the troublesome
      priests as cavalierly as he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the priests made a third knot in the tangle and tried desperately at
      the last moment to recreate dissension between the rival royal camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr is getting ready to attack you!&rdquo; they assured Howrah. &ldquo;Attack him
      first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait until he does attack,&rdquo; the Maharajah answered. &ldquo;For the
      moment we are friends and have a cause in common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howrah's men will desert to you the moment you make a move to win the
      throne,&rdquo; they assured Jaimihr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; answered Jaimihr. &ldquo;Wait but a day or two. I will move fast as I
      see fit when I am ready. For the present my cause and my brother's cause
      are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spies brought in news to Maharajah, Prince, and priest of the hurried
      raising of a Rangar army. The Maharajah and the Prince laughed up their
      sleeves and the priests swore horribly; the interjection of another
      element&mdash;another creed&mdash;into the complication did not suit the
      priestly &ldquo;book.&rdquo; They were the only men who were really worried about
      Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      And another spy&mdash;Joanna&mdash;disappeared. No longer garbed as a man,
      she had hung about the palace, and&mdash;known to nearly all the sweepers&mdash;she
      had overheard things. Garbed as a man again, she suddenly evaporated in
      thin air, and Rosemary McClean was left without a servant or any means of
      communication with the outside world.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    The ringed wolf glared the circle round
    Through baleful, blue-lit eye,
    Not unforgetful of his debt.
    &ldquo;Now, heed ye how ye draw the net.&rdquo;
     Quoth he:  &ldquo;I'll do some damage yet
    Or ere my turn to die!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      THE mare that had been a present from Mahommed Gunga was brought out and
      saddled, together with a fresh horse for the Risaldar. The veteran had
      needed no summoning, for with a soldier's instinct he had wakened at the
      moment his self-allotted four hours had expired. He mounted a little
      stiffly, and tried his horse's paces up and down the courtyard once or
      twice before nodding to Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was one other matter, after all, that needed attention first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That horse of mine that brought me hither&rdquo;&mdash;the Risaldar picked out
      the man who waited with the gong cord in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;is left in thy
      particular charge. Dost thou hear me? I will tell the Alwa-sahib what I
      now tell thee&mdash;that horse will be required of thee fit,
      good-tempered, light-mouthed, not spur-marked, and thoroughly well
      groomed. There will be a reward in the one case, but in the other&mdash;I
      would not stand in thy shoes! It is a trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Risaldar!&rdquo; called Cunningham. &ldquo;We're wasting an awful lot of
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib, but a good horse is like a woman, to be loved and treated
      faithfully! Neither horse nor woman should be sacrificed for less than
      duty! Lead on, bahadur&mdash;I will join thee at the gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had several directions to give for the horse's better care, and
      Cunningham was forced to wait at least five minutes for him at the foot of
      the steep descent. Then for another minute the two sat their horses side
      by side, while the great gate rose slowly, grudgingly, cranked upward by
      four men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we two ever ride under here again, bahadur, we shall ride with honor
      thick on us,&rdquo; remarked Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;God knows what thy plan may be;
      but I know that from now on there will be no peace for either of us until
      we have helped rip it with our blades from the very belly of rebellion.
      Ride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate clanged down behind them as&mdash;untouched by heel or spur&mdash;the
      two spring-limbed chargers raced for their bits across the sand. They went
      like shadows, casting other shadows&mdash;moon-made&mdash;wind-driven&mdash;knee-to-knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Risaldar broke silence after fifteen minutes. Neither he nor
      Cunningham were of the type that chatters when the time has come to loosen
      sabres and sit tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of what lies ahead&mdash;as I said, neither I nor any man
      knows what this plan of thine may be, but I and the others have accepted
      thy bare word. These men who await thee&mdash;and they are many, and all
      soldiers, good, seasoned horsemen&mdash;have been told that the son of
      Cunnigan will lead them. Alwa has given his word, and I mine, that in the
      matter of a leader there is nothing left to be desired. And my five men
      have told them of certain happenings that they have seen. Therefore, thou
      art awaited with no little keenness. They will be all eyes and ears. It
      might be well, then, to set the pace a little slower, for a man looks
      better on a fresh horse than on a weary one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking, Mahommed Gunga, of the two McCleans and of General Byng,
      who is expecting us. There is little time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, consider them, sahib. It is we Rangars who must do the sabre
      work. ALL, sahib&mdash;ALL&mdash;depends now on the impression created on
      the men awaiting thee! Rein in a little. Thy father's name, thine own, and
      mine and Alwa's weigh for much on thy side; but have a sound horse between
      thy legs and a trumpet in thy throat when we get there! I have seen more
      than one officer have to fight up-hill for the hearts of his troopers
      because his tired horse stumbled or looked shabby on the first parade.
      Draw rein a little, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Cunningham, still saying nothing, drew back into an easy canter. He was
      conscious of something, not at all like a trumpet, in his throat that was
      nearly choking him. He did not care to let Mahommed Gunga know that what
      was being mistaken for masterly silence was really emotion! He did not
      speak because he did not trust his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three squadrons, sahib&mdash;each of about five hundred men.
      Alwa has the right wing, I the left. Take thou the centre and command the
      whole. The horses are as good as any in this part of India, for each man
      has brought his best to do thee honor. Each man carries four days' rations
      in his saddle-bag and two days' rations for his horse. More horse feed is
      collecting, and they are bringing wagons, to follow when we give the word.
      But we thought there would be little sense in ordering wagons to follow us
      to Howrah City, knowing that thy plan would surely entail action. If we
      are to ride to the aid of Byng-bahadur it seemed better to pick up the
      wagons on the journey back again. That is all, sahib. There will be no
      time, of course, to waste on talk or drill. Take charge the moment that we
      get there&mdash;issue thy orders&mdash;and trust to the men understanding
      each command. Lead off without delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cunningham&mdash;two English words that went much
      further to allay the Risaldar's anxiety than any amount of rhetoric would
      have done. &ldquo;But&mdash;d'you mean to tell me that the men don't understand
      words of command?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them do, sahib&mdash;but to many of them the English words are
      new. They all understand formations, and those who know the English words
      are teaching the others while they wait for us. There is not one man among
      them but has couched a lance or swung a sabre in some force or other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Have they all got lances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the front-rank men are armed with lance and sabre&mdash;the rear
      ranks have sabres only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After two hours of steady cantering the going changed and became a quick
      succession of ever-deepening gorges cleft in sandstone. Far away in the
      distance to the left there rose a glow that showed where Howrah City kept
      uneasy vigil, doubtless with watch-fires at every street corner. It looked
      almost as though the distant city were in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of them lay the gloom of hell mouth and the silence of the space
      beyond the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with that strange, unclassified, unnamed sixth sense that soldiers,
      savages, and certain hunters have that Cunningham became aware of life
      ahead of him&mdash;massed, strong-breathing, ready&mdash;waiting life,
      spring-bent in the quivering blackness. A little farther, and he caught
      the ring of a curb-chain. Then a horse whinnied and a hoarse voice swore
      low at a restive charger. His own mare neighed, throwing her head high,
      and some one challenged through the dead-black night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How-ut! Hukkums&mdash;thar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A horseman appeared suddenly from nowhere, and examined them at close
      quarters instead of waiting for their answer. He peered curiously at
      Cunningham&mdash;glanced at Mahommed Gunga&mdash;then wheeled, spinning
      his horse as the dust eddies twist in the sudden hot-wind gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib-bahadur hai!&rdquo; he shouted, racing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was instantly alive with jingling movement, as line after line
      of quite invisible light-horse-men&mdash;self-disciplined and eager to
      obey&mdash;took up their dressing. The overhanging cliff of sandstone hid
      the moon, but here and there there was a gleam of eyeballs in the dark&mdash;now
      man's, now horse's&mdash;and a sheen that was the hint of steel held
      vertical. No human being could have guessed the length of the gorge nor
      the number of the men who waited in it, for the restless chargers stamped
      in inch-deep sand that deadened sound without seeming to lessen its
      quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salaam, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Alwa, saluting with drawn sabre, reining back a pedigreed mare to
      get all the spectacular emotion out of the encounter that he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are fifteen hundred eight and fifty, sahib&mdash;all Rangars&mdash;true
      believers&mdash;all true men&mdash;all pledged to see thee unsinged
      through the flames of hell! Do them the honor of a quick inspection,
      sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; smiled Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told them, sahib, that their homes, their women, their
      possessions, and their honor are all guaranteed them. Also pay. They make
      no other terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guarantee them all of that,&rdquo; said Cunningham, loud enough for at least
      the nearest ranks to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On thine own honor, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word of honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The promise is enough! Will you inspect them, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take their salute first,&rdquo; said Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, bahadur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa filled his lungs and faced the unseen lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rangars!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Your leader! To Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur&mdash;son of
      Pukka-Cunnigan whom we all knew&mdash;general&mdash;salute&mdash;present&mdash;sabres!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was sudden movement&mdash;the ring of whipped-out metal&mdash;a
      bird's wing-beat&mdash;as fifteen hundred hilts rose all together to as
      many lips&mdash;and a sharp intake of breath all down the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't bad. Not bad at all, thought Cunningham. It was not done as
      regulars would have worked it. There was the little matter of the lances,
      that he could make out dimly here and there, and he could detect even in
      that gloom that half of the men had been caught wondering how to salute
      with lance and sabre both. But that was not their fault; the effort&mdash;the
      respect behind the effort&mdash;the desire to act altogether&mdash;were
      all there and striving. He drew his own mare back a little, and returned
      their salute with full military dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reeeecee&mdash;turn&mdash;sabres!&rdquo; ordered Alwa, and that movement was
      accomplished better.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode once, slowly, down the long front rank, letting each man look him
      over&mdash;then back again along the rear rank, risking a kick or two, for
      there was little room between them and the cliff. He was not choking now.
      The soldier instinct, that is born in a man like statesmanship or poetry,
      but that never can be taught, had full command over all his other senses,
      and when he spurred out to the front again his voice rang loud and clear,
      like a trumpet through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      With fifty ground scouts scattered out ahead of them, they drummed out of
      the gorge and thundered by squadrons on the plain beyond&mdash;straight,
      as the jackal runs, for Howrah City. Alwa, leaving his own squadron, to
      canter at Cunningham's side, gave him all the new intelligence that
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last evening I sent word on ahead to them of our coming, sahib! I sent
      one messenger to the Maharajah and one to Jaimihr, warning each that we
      ride to keep our plighted word. At the worst, we shall find both parties
      ready for us! We shall know before we reach the city who is our friend!
      News reached me, too, sahib, that the Maharajah and his brother have
      united against us&mdash;that Howrah will eat his promises and play me
      false. God send he does! I would like to have my hands in that Hindoo's
      treasure-chests! We none of us know yet, bahadur, what is this plan of
      thine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been guessing awfully close to it, I think&rdquo; laughed Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! The treasure-chests, then! But&mdash;is there&mdash;have you
      information, sahib? Who knows, then&mdash;who has told where they are?
      Neither I nor my men know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for Mahommed Gunga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga left his squadron, too, to canter beside Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all ears, sahib!&rdquo; he asserted, reining his horse until his stride
      was equal to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The key to the situation is that treasure,&rdquo; asserted Cunningham. &ldquo;Howrah
      wants it. Jaimihr wants it. The priests want it. I know that much for
      certain, from the McCleans. All right. We're a new factor in the problem,
      and they all mistrust us nearly as much, if not more, than they mistrust
      one another. Good. They'll be all of them watching that treasure. It'll be
      near where they are, and I'm going to snaffle it or break my neck&mdash;and
      all your necks&mdash;in the deuced desperate attempt. Is that clear? Where
      the carcass is, there wheel the kites and there the jackals fight, as your
      proverb says. The easiest part will be finding the treasure. Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They legged in closer to him, hanging on his words and too busy listening
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Howrah thinks we're after the treasure and decides to fight without
      previous argument, that absolves you from your promise, doesn't it,
      Alwa-sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahib, provided our intention is not to evade the promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our intention is to prevent Howrah and his brother from fighting, to
      insure peace and protection on this whole countryside, and, if possible,
      to ride away with Jaimihr's army to the Company's aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to occur to none of the three that fifteen hundred mounted men
      were somewhat few with which to accomplish such a marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are fighting already, we must interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready, bahadur. Fighting is our trade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, before all things, we must keep our eyes well skinned for a hint of
      treachery on Jaimihr's part. I would rather quarrel with that gentleman
      than be his friend, but he happens to hold our promise. We've got to keep
      our promise, provided he keeps his. I think our first objective is the
      treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sahib, is an acrobat of a plan,&rdquo; said Alwa; &ldquo;much jumping from one
      proposition to another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no plan at all,&rdquo; said Cunningham. &ldquo;It is a mere rehearsal of the
      circumstances. A plan is something quickly seized at the right second and
      then acted on&mdash;like your capture of Jaimihr. Wait awhile,
      Alwa-sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, wait awhile!&rdquo; growled Mahommed Gunga. &ldquo;Did I bring thee a leader to
      ask plans of thee, or a man of men for thee to follow? Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Alwa, &ldquo;I would rather halt and make a good plan. It
      would be wiser. I do not understand this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I follow Cunnigan-bahadur!&rdquo; said Mahommed Gunga; and he spurred off to
      his squadron. Alwa could see nothing better than to follow suit, for
      Cunningham closed his lips tight in a manner unmistakable. And whatever
      Alwa's misgivings might have been, he had the sense and the soldierly
      determination not to hint at them to his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As dawn rose pale-yellow in the eastern sky they thundered into view of
      Howrah City and drew rein to breathe their horses. The sun was high before
      they had trotted near enough to make out details. But, long before details
      could be seen, it was evident that an army was formed up to meet them on
      the tree-lined maidan that lay between them and the two-mile-long
      palace-wall. Beyond all doubt it was Jaimihr's army, for his elephants
      were not so gaudily harnessed as Howrah's, and his men were not so
      brilliantly dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they dipped into the last depression between them and the wall and
      halted for a minute's consultation, a khaki-clad, shrivelled figure of a
      man leaped up from behind a sand-ridge, and raced toward Cunningham,
      shouting to him in a dialect he had no knowledge of and gesticulating
      wildly. A trooper spurred down on him, brought him up all standing with an
      intercepted lance, examined him through puckered eyes, and then, roaring
      with laughter, picked him up and carried him to Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman, sahib! By the beard of Abraham, a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joanna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, sahib! Ha, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She babbled to him, word overtaking word and choking all together in a
      dust-dry throat. Cunningham gave her water and then set her on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Translate, somebody!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I can't understand a word she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babbled and hurried and a little vague it might be, but Joanna had the
      news of the minute pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr is looting the treasure now, sahib. He has tricked his brother.
      They were to join, and both fight against you, but Jaimihr tried to get
      the treasure out before either you or his brother came. He is trying now,
      sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McClean! Ask her where Miss McClean is! Ask for Miss Maklin, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jaimihr has told her that thou and Alwa and Mahommed Gunga are all dead,
      and the British overwhelmed throughout all India! He has her with him in a
      carriage, under guard, for all his men are with him and he could spare no
      great guard for his palace. See! Look, sahib! Jaimihr's palace is in
      flames!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa all but fell from his charger, laughing volcanically. The Rajput, who
      never can agree, can always see the humor in other Rajputs' disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, but they are playing a great game with each other!&rdquo; he shouted. But
      Cunningham decided he had wasted time enough. He shouted his orders, and
      in less than thirty seconds his three squadrons were thundering in the
      direction of Jaimihr's army and the palace-wall. They drew rein again
      within a quarter of a mile of it, to discover with amazed military eyes
      that Jaimihr had no artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then, at the moment when they halted, that Jaimihr reached a quick
      decision and the wrong one. He knew by now that his brother had won the
      first trick in the game of treachery, for he could see the smoke and
      flames of his burning palace from where he sat his horse. He decided at
      once that Alwa and his Rangars must have taken sides with the Maharajah,
      for how, otherwise, he reasoned, could the Maharajah dare let the Rangars
      approach unwatched and unmolested. It was evident to him that the Rangars
      were acting as part of a concerted movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made up his mind to attack and beat off the new arrivals without
      further ceremony. He out-numbered them by four or five to one, and was on
      his own ground. Whatever their intentions, at least he would be able to
      pretend afterward that he had acted in defence of the sacred treasure; and
      then, with the treasure in his possession, he would soon be able to
      recompense himself for a mere burned and looted palace!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he opened fire without notice, argument, or parley, and an ill-aimed
      volley shrieked over the heads of Cunningham's three squadrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, unruffled and undecided still, made out through puckered eyes
      the six-horse carriage in which Miss McClean evidently was; it was drawn
      up close beside the wall, and two regiments were between it and his
      squadron. He was recalling the terms of the agreement made with Jaimihr;
      he remembered it included the sparing of all of Alwa's men, and not the
      firing on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand of Jaimihr's cavalry swooped from the shelter of the infantry,
      opened out a very little, and, mistaking Cunningham's delay for fear, bore
      down with a cheer and something very like determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were met some ten yards their side of the half-way mark by
      Cunningham's three squadrons, loosed and led by Cunningham himself.
      Outridden, outfought, outgeneralled, they were smashed through, ridden
      down, and whirled back reeling in confusion. About a hundred of them
      reached the shelter of the infantry in a formed-up body; many of the rest
      charged through it in a mob and threw it into confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late Jaimihr decided on more reasonable tactics. Too late he gave
      orders to his infantry that no such confused body could obey. Before he
      could ride to rally them, the Rangars were in them, at them, through them,
      over them. The whole was disintegrating in retreat, endeavoring to rally
      and reform in different places, each subdivision shouting orders to its
      nearest neighbor and losing heart as its appeals for help were
      disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back came Cunningham's close-formed squadrons, straight through the
      writhing mass again; and now the whole of Jaimihr's army took to its
      heels, just as part of the five-feet-thick stone palace-wall succumbed to
      the attacks of crowbars and crashed down in the roadway, disclosing a dark
      vault on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr made a rush for the six-horse carriage, and tried vainly to get it
      started. Cunningham shouted to him to surrender, but he took no notice of
      the challenge; he escaped being made prisoner by the narrowest of margins,
      as the position next him was cut down. The other postilions were
      un-horsed, and six Rangars changed mounts and seized the reins. The Prince
      ran one man through the middle, and then spurred off to try and overtake
      his routed army, some of which showed a disposition to form up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit quiet!&rdquo; called Cunningham through the latticed carriage window.
      &ldquo;You're safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy, swaying carriage rumbled round, and the horses plunged in
      answer to the Rangars' heels. A moment later it was moving at a gallop;
      two minutes later it was backed against the wall, and Rosemary McClean
      stepped out behind three protecting squadrons that had not suffered
      perceptibly from what they would have scorned to call a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now all together!&rdquo; shouted Cunningham, whose theories on the value of
      seconds when tackling reforming infantry were worthy of the Duke of
      Wellington, or any other officer who knew his business; and again he led
      his men at a breakneck charge. This time Jaimihr's disheartened little
      army did not wait for him, but broke into wild confusion and scattered
      right and left, leaving their elephants to be captured. There were only a
      few men killed. The lance-tipped, roaring whirlwind loosed itself for the
      most part against nothing, and reformed uninjured to trot back again.
      Cunningham told off two troops to pursue fugitives and keep their eyes
      open for the Prince before he rode back to examine the breach in the wall
      that Jaimihr had been to so much trouble about making.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had halted to peer through the break in the age-old masonry when
      Mahommed Gunga spurred up close to him, touched his arm, and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, sahib! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr&mdash;and no one but a wizard could have told how he had managed
      to get to where he was unobserved&mdash;was riding as a man rides at a
      tent-peg, crouching low, full-pelt for Rosemary McClean!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham's spurs went home before the word was out of Mahommed Gunga's
      mouth, and Mahommed Gunga raced behind him; but Jaimihr had the start of
      them. Duncan McClean, looking ill and weak and helpless, crowded his
      daughter to the wall, standing between her and the Prince; but Jaimihr
      aimed a swinging sabre at him, and the missionary fell. His daughter
      stooped to bend over him, and Jaimihr seized her below the arms. A second
      later he had hoisted her to his saddle-bow and was spurring
      hell-bent-for-leather for the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things prevented him from making his escape. Five of Alwa's men,
      returning from pursuing fugitives, cut off his flight in one direction,
      and the extra weight on his horse prevented him from getting clear by
      means of speed alone&mdash;as he might have done otherwise, for
      Cunningham's mare was growing tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr rode for two minutes with the frenzy of a savage before he saw the
      futility of it. It was Cunningham's mare, gaining on him stride over
      stride, that warned him he would be cut down like a dog from behind unless
      he surrendered or let go his prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he laughed and threw the girl to the ground. For a moment more he
      spurted, spurring like a fiend, then wheeled and charged at Cunningham. He
      guessed that but for Cunningham that number of Rangars would never have
      agreed on a given plan. He knew that it was he, and not Cunningham or Alwa
      or Rosemary McClean, who had broken faith. He had broken it in thought,
      and word, and action. And he had lost his prospect of a throne. So he came
      on like a man who has nothing to gain by considering his safety. He came
      like a real man at last. And Cunningham, on a tired mare, met him point to
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fought over a quarter of a mile of ground, for Jaimihr proved to be
      as useful with his weapon as Mahommed Gunga's teaching had made
      Cunningham. There was plenty of time for the reformed squadrons to see
      what was happening&mdash;plenty of time for Alwa, who considered that he
      had an account of his own to settle with the Prince, to leave his squadron
      and come thundering up to help. Mahommed Gunga dodged and reined and
      spurred, watching his opportunity on one side and Alwa on the other. It
      would have suited neither of them to have their leader killed at that
      stage of the game, but the fighting was too quick for either man to
      interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaimihr charged Cunningham for the dozenth time and missed, charged past,
      to wheel and charge again, then closed with the most vindictive rush of
      all. Again Cunningham met him point to point. The two blades locked, and
      bent like springs as they wrenched at them. Cunningham's blade snapped. He
      snatched at his mare and spun her before Jaimihr could recover, then
      rammed both spurs in and bore down on the Prince with half a sabre. He had
      him on the near side at a disadvantage. Jaimihr spurred and tried to
      maneuver for position, and the half sabre went home just below his ribs.
      He dropped bleeding in the dust at the second that Alwa and Mahommed Gunga
      each saw an opportunity and rushed in, to rein back face to face, grinning
      in each other's faces, their horses' breasts pressed tight against the
      charger that Jaimihr rode. The horse screamed as the shock crushed the
      wind out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You robbed me of my man, sahib, by about a sabre's breadth!&rdquo; laughed
      Alwa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you left your squadron leaderless without my permission!&rdquo; answered
      Cunningham. &ldquo;You too! Mahommed Gunga!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer to argue or obey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahommed Gunga flushed and rode back. Alwa grinned and started after him.
      Cunningham, without another glance at the dead Prince, rode up to Rosemary
      McClean, who was picking herself up and looking bewildered; she had
      watched the duel in speechless silence, lying full length in the dust, and
      she still could not speak when he reached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your foot on mine,&rdquo; he said reassuringly; &ldquo;then swing yourself up
      behind me if you can. If you can't, I'll pick you up in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried hard, but she failed; so he put both arms under hers and lifted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I welcome?&rdquo; he asked. And she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh from killing a man&mdash;with a man's blood on his broken sword and
      the sweat of fighting not yet dry on him&mdash;he held a woman in his arms
      for the first time in his life. His hand had been steady when it struck
      the blow under Jaimihr's ribs, but now it trembled. His eyes had been
      stern and blazing less than two minutes before; now they looked down into
      nothing more dangerous than a woman's eyes and grew strangely softer all
      at once. His mouth had been a hard, tight line under a scrubby upper lip,
      but his lips had parted now a little and his smile was a boy's&mdash;not
      nervous or mischievous&mdash;a happy boy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, too. Most people did smile when young Cunningham looked
      pleased with them; but she smiled differently. And he, with that blood
      still wet on him, bent down and kissed her on the lips. Her answer was as
      characteristic as his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a blackguard,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;but you came, and I knew you
      would! I told Jaimihr you would, and he laughed at me. I told God you
      would, and you came! How long is it since you shaved? Your chin is all
      prickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by a roar from the three waiting squadrons. He had
      ridden without caring where he went, and his mare had borne the two of
      them to where the squadrons were drawn up with their rear to the great gap
      in the wall. The situation suited every Rangar of them! That was, indeed,
      the way a man should win his woman! They cheered him, and cheered again,
      and he grinned back, knowing that their hearts were in the cheering and
      their good will won. Red, then, as a boiled beet, he rode over to the
      six-horse carriage and dismounted by her father&mdash;picked him up&mdash;called
      two troopers&mdash;and lifted him on to the rear seat of the great
      old-fashioned coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get inside beside him!&rdquo; he ordered Rosemary, examining the missionary's
      head as he spoke. &ldquo;It's a scalp wound, and he's stunned&mdash;no more.
      He's left off bleeding already. Nurse him!&rdquo; He was off, then, without
      another word or a backward glance for her&mdash;off to his men and the gap
      in the wall that waited an investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazing was discovered then. The treasure&mdash;the fabled, fabulous,
      enormous Howrah treasure was no fable. It was there, behind that wall! The
      jewels and the bullion in marketable bars that could have bought an army
      or a kingdom&mdash;the sacred, secret treasure of twenty troubled
      generations, that was guarded in the front by fifty doors and fifty
      corridors and three times fifty locks&mdash;the door of whose secret vault
      was guarded by a cannon, set to explode at the slightest touch&mdash;was
      hidden from the public road at its other side, its rear, by nothing better
      than a five-foot wall of ill-cemented stone! Cunningham stepped inside
      over the dismantled masonry and sat down on a chest that held more money's
      worth than all the Cunninghams in all the world had ever owned, or spent,
      or owed, or used, or dreamed of!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Alwa and Mahommed Gunga to come to me here!&rdquo; he called; and a minute
      later they stood at attention in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a hundred men, each with a flag of truce on his lance, to gallop
      through the city and call on Jaimihr's men to rally to me, if they wish
      protection against Howrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, sahib! Good!&rdquo; swore Alwa. &ldquo;Howrah is the next danger! Make ready to
      fight Howrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attend to my orders, please!&rdquo; smiled Cunningham, and Alwa did as he was
      told. Within an hour Jaimihr's men were streaming from the four quarters
      of the compass, hurrying to be on the winning side, and forming into
      companies as they were ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cunningham gave another order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alwa-sahib, will you take another flag of truce, please, and ride with
      not more than two men to Maharajah Howrah. Tell him that I want him here
      at once to settle about this treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alwa stared. His mouth opened a little, and he stood like a man bereft of
      reason by the unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not still pledged to support Howrah on his throne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, bahadur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would plundering his treasure be in keeping with your promise to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be good enough to take my message to him. Assure him that he may come
      with ten men without fear of molestation, but guarantee to him that if he
      comes with more than ten&mdash;and with however many more&mdash;I will
      fight, and keep his treasure, both!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Friends I have sought me of varying nations,
    Men of all ranks and of different stations;
            Some are in jail now, and some are deceased.
    Two, though, I found to be experts at sundering
    Me from my revenue, leaving me wondering
    Which was the costlier&mdash;soldier or priest.
</pre>
    <p>
      A LITTLE more than one hour later, Howrah&mdash;sulky and disgruntled, but
      doing his level best to appear at Ease&mdash;faced young Cunningham across
      a table in the treasure-vault. Outside was a row of wagons, drawn by
      horses and closely guarded by a squadron of the Rangars. Behind Cunningham
      stood Alwa and Mahommed Gunga; behind the Maharajah were two of his court
      officials. There were pen and ink and the royal seal between them on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Maharajah-sahib. They are all scaled, and each chest is marked on the
      outside with its contents; I'm sorry there was no time to weigh the gold,
      but the number of the ingots ought to be enough. And, of course, you'll
      understand it wasn't possible to count all those unset stones&mdash;that
      'ud take a week; but your seal is on that big chest, too, so you'll know
      if it's been opened. You are certain you can preserve the peace of your
      state with the army you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Howrah curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want me to leave a squadron of my men to help you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He said that even more abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Of course, since you won't have to spare men to guard the treasure
      now, you'll have all the more to keep peace in the district with, won't
      you? Let me repeat the terms of our bargain&mdash;they're written here,
      but let's be sure there is no mistake. I agree to deliver your treasure
      into safe keeping until the rebellion is over, and to report to my
      government that you are friendly disposed toward us. You, in return,
      guarantee to protect the families and property of all these gentlemen who
      ride with me. It is mutually agreed that any damage done to their homes
      during their absence shall be made good out of your treasure, but that
      should you keep your part of the agreement the treasure shall be handed
      back to you intact. Is that correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Howrah shifting in his seat uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other thing. I am outmaneuvered, and I have surrendered with the best
      grace possible. That agreement stands in my name, and no other man's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priests of Siva are not parties to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had nothing whatever to do with them,&rdquo; said Cunningham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, then, sahib. I am satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we're about it, Maharajah-sahib, let's scotch those priests
      altogether! McClean-sahib has told me that suttee has been practised here
      as a regular thing. That's got to stop, and we may as well stop it now. Of
      course, I shall keep my word about the treasure, and you'll get it back if
      you live up to the bargain you have made; but my government will know now
      where it is, and they'll be likely to impose a quite considerable fine on
      you when the rebellion's over unless this suttee's put an end to. Besides,
      you couldn't think of a better way of scoring off the priests than by
      enforcing the law and abolishing the practice. Think that over,
      Maharajah-sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Howrah swore into his beard, as any ruling potentate might well do at
      being dictated to by a boy of twenty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, sahib,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am with the British&mdash;not
      against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you!&mdash;er, I mean, that's right!&rdquo; He turned to Alwa, and
      looked straight into his eyes. &ldquo;Are you satisfied with the guarantee?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, I am more than satisfied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Oh, and&mdash;Maharajah-sahib&mdash;since we've fought your battle
      for you&mdash;and lost a few men&mdash;and are going to guard your
      treasure for you, and be your friends, and all that kind of thing&mdash;don't
      you think you'd like to do something for us&mdash;not much, but just a
      little thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in your power. You have but to command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I don't want to force anything. We're friends&mdash;talking as
      friends. I ask a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is granted, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse or two, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many horses, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not more than one each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Maharajah pulled a wry face, but bowed assent. It would empty his
      stables very nearly, but he knew when he could not help himself. Mahommed
      Gunga clapped a hand to his mouth and left the vault hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand this is not a demand, Maharajah-sahib. I take it that you
      offer me these horses as an act of royal courtesy and as additional proof
      of friendliness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men will be very grateful to you. This will enable them to reach the
      scene of action with their own horses in good shape. I'm sure it's awfully
      good of you to have offered them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, where the late afternoon sun was gradually letting things cool
      down, Mahommed Gunga leaned against the wall and roared with laughter, as
      he explained a few details to the admiring troopers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse or two, says he! How many? Oh, just a horse or two,
      Maharajah-sahib&mdash;merely a horse apiece! Fifteen hundred horses! A
      horse or two! Oh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho! Allah! But that boy will make a better
      soldier than his father! As a favor, he asked them&mdash;no compulsion,
      mind you&mdash;just as a favor! Allah! What is he asking now, I wonder!
      Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And inside, with a perfectly straight face and almost ghastly generosity,
      young Cunningham proceeded to impose on Howrah the transferred, unwelcome,
      perilous allegiance of Jaimihr's reassembling army. The mere keeping of it
      in subjection, it was realized by donor and recipient alike, would keep
      the Maharajah's hands full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied that your homes will be safe, now?&rdquo; he asked Alwa. And
      Alwa looked him in the eyes and grinned.

      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Now, fifteen hundred, horse and man,
    Reel at the word of one!
    Loosed by the brazen trumpet's peal&mdash;
    Knee to knee and toe on heel&mdash;
    Troop on troop the squadrons wheel
            Outbrazening the sun!
</pre>
    <p>
      WITHIN a fortnight of the outbreak of the mutiny, men spoke with bated
      breath about the Act of God. It burst at the moment when India's reins
      were in the hands of some of the worst incompetents in history. A week
      found strong men in control of things&mdash;the right men, with the right
      handful behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the men in charge went mad, and were relieved. Some threw up their
      commands. Some of the worst incompetents were killed by the mutineers, and
      more than one man who could have changed the course of history for the
      worse were taken sick and died. Instead of finding themselves faced by
      spineless nincompoops, the rebels reeled before the sudden, well-timed
      tactics of real officers with eyes and ears and brains. The mask was off
      on both sides, and the sudden, stripped efficiency of one was no less
      disconcerting than the unexpected rebellion of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Byng-bahadur&mdash;&ldquo;Byng the Brigadier&rdquo;&mdash;was in command of a force
      again within three days of the news of the first massacre; and because he
      was Byng, with Byng's record, and Byng's ability to handle loyal natives,
      the men who succeeded to the reins packed him off at once with a free
      hand, and with no other orders than to hit, hit hard, and keep on hitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go for them, Byng, old man. Live off the country, keep moving, and don't
      let 'em guess once what your next move's going to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Byng recruited as he went, and struck like a brain-controlled tornado
      at whatever crossed his path. But irreparable damage had been done before
      the old school was relieved, and Byng&mdash;like others&mdash;was terribly
      short of men. Many of his own irregulars were so enraged at having been
      disbanded at a moment's notice that they refused to return to him. Their
      honor, as they saw it, had been outraged. Only two British regiments could
      be spared him, and they were both thinned by sickness from the first. They
      were Sikhs, who formed the bulk of his headquarterless brigade, and many
      of them were last-minute friends, who came to him unorganized and almost
      utterly undrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Byng was a man of genius, and his bare reputation was enough to offset
      much in the way of unpreparedness. He coaxed and licked and praised his
      new men into shape as he went along; within a week he had stormed
      Deeseera, blowing up their greatest reserve of ammunition and momentarily
      stunning the rebellion's leaders. But cholera took charge in the city, and
      two days later found him hurrying out again, to camp where there was
      uncontaminated water, on rising ground that gave him the command of three
      main roads. It was there that the rebels cornered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They blew up a hundred-yard-long bridge behind him at the one point where
      a swiftly running river could be crossed, and from two other sides at once
      mutinied native regiments and thousands from the countryside flocked,
      hurrying to take a hand in what seemed destined to be Byng's last action.
      The fact that so many swaggering soldier Sikhs were cornered with him was
      sufficient in itself to bring out Hindoo and Mohammedan alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mutinous regiments had all been drilled and taught by British officers
      until they were as nearly perfect as the military knowledge of the day
      could make them; the fact that they had killed their officers only served
      to make them savage without detracting much from their efficiency. They
      had native officers quite capable of taking charge, and sense enough to
      retain their discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Byng intrenched himself on the gradual rise, and sent out as many
      messengers as he could spare to bring reinforcements from whatever source
      obtainable. Then, when almost none came, he got ready to die where he
      stood, using all the soldier gift he had to put courage into the
      last-ditch loyalists who offered to die with him. He had counted most on
      aid from Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga, but that source seemed to have
      failed him; and he gave up hope of their arrival when a body of several
      thousand rebels took up position on his flank and cut off approach from
      the direction whence Cunningham should come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun blazed down like molten hell on sick and wounded. Rotting
      carcasses of horses and cattle, killed by the rebels' artillery-fire, lay
      stenching here and there, and there was no possibility of disposing of
      them. A day came very soon, indeed, when horse, or occasional transport
      bullock, was all there was to eat, and a night came when Govind Singh, the
      leader of the Sikhs, came to him and remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man had to be carried to Byng's tent, for a round shot had
      disabled him, and he had himself set down by the tent-door, where the
      General sat on a camp-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General-sahib, I have not been asked for advice; I am here to offer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huge black dome of heaven was punctuated by a billion dots of steely
      white that looked like pin-pricks. All the light there was came from the
      fitful watch-fires, where even the wagons were being burned now that the
      meagre supply of rough timber was giving out. The rebels, too, were
      burning everything on which they could lay their hands, and from between
      the spaced-out glow of their bonfires came ever and again the spurt of
      cannon-flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Govind Singh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sahib, we have no artillery with which to answer them. We have no food;
      and the supply of ammunition wanes. Shall we die here like cattle in a
      slaughter-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is as good as any other place&rdquo; said Byng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sahib!&rdquo; &ldquo;How, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their lines is a better place! Here is nothing better than a shambles,
      with none but our men falling. They know that our food is giving out&mdash;they
      know that we lose heavily&mdash;they wait. They will wait for days yet
      before they close in to finish what their guns have but begun, and&mdash;then&mdash;how
      many will there be to die desperately, as is fitting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might get reinforcements in the morning, Govind Singh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And again, we might not, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent a number of messengers before we were shut in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sahib&mdash;and to whom? To men who would ask you to reinforce them
      if they could get word to you! Tomorrow our rear will be surrounded, too;
      they have laid planks across the little streams behind us, and are
      preparing to drag guns to that side, too. Now, sahib, we have fire left in
      us. We can smite yet, and do damage while we die. Tomorrow night may find
      us decimated and without heart for the finish. I advise you to advance at
      dawn, sahib!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That advice came as a great relief to Byng-bahadur. He had been the first
      to see the hopelessness of the position, and every instinct that he had
      told him to finish matters, not in the last reeking ditch, but ahead,
      where the enemy would suffer fearfully while a desperate charge roared
      into them, to peter out when the last man went down fighting. Surrender
      was unthinkable, and in any event would have been no good, for the
      mutineers would be sure to butcher all their prisoners; his only other
      chance had been to hold out until relief came, and that hope was now
      forlorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Mohammedan stepped out of blackness and saluted him&mdash;a native
      officer, in charge of a handful of irregular cavalry, whose horses had all
      been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sahib. Do we die here? I and my men would prefer to die yonder,
      where a mutineer or two would pay the price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Ghoorka officer&mdash;small as a Japanese and sturdy-looking came up
      next. The whole thing was evidently preconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men ask leave to show the way into the ranks ahead, General-sahib!
      They are overweary of this shambles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will advance at dawn!&rdquo; said Byng. &ldquo;Egan&mdash;&rdquo; He turned to a British
      officer, who was very nearly all the staff he had. &ldquo;Drag that table up.
      Let's have some paper here and a pencil, and we'll work out the best plan
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent for the commanding officers of the British regiments&mdash;both of
      them captains, but the seniors surviving&mdash;and a weird scene followed
      round the lamp set on the tiny table. British, Sikh, Mohammedan, and
      Ghoorka clustered close to him, and watched as his pencil traced the
      different positions and showed the movement that was to make the morrow's
      finish, their faces outlined in the lamp's yellow glow and their breath
      coming deep and slow as they agreed on how the greatest damage could be
      done the enemy before the last man died.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he finished, and assigned each leader to his share in the last assault
      that any one of them would take a part in, a streak of light blazed
      suddenly across the sky. A shooting-star swept in a wide parabola to the
      horizon. A murmur went up from the wakeful lines, and the silence of the
      graveyard followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is our sign, sahib!&rdquo; laughed the Mohammedan. The old Sikh nodded
      and the Ghoorka grinned. &ldquo;It is the end!&rdquo; he said, without a trace of
      discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Byng, his face, too, turned upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, does it mean, sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;it means that God Almighty has relieved a picket! We're the
      picket. We're relieved! We advance at dawn, and we'll get through somehow!
      Join your commands, gentlemen, and explain the details carefully to your
      men&mdash;let's have no misunderstandings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dawn rose gold and beautiful upon a sleepless camp that reeked and
      steamed with hell-hot suffering. It showed the rebels stationary, still in
      swarming lines, but scouts reported several thousand of them moving in a
      body from the flank toward the British rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proportion of the rebel force?&rdquo; asked Byng. &ldquo;New arrivals, or some
      of the old ones taking up a new position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same crowd, sir. They're just moving round to hem us in completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for us, then! That leaves fewer for us to deal with in
      front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke another man came running to report the arrival of five
      gallopers, coming hell-bent-for leather, one by one and scattered, with
      the evident purpose of allowing one man to get through, whatever happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be relief at last!&rdquo; said Byng-bahadur. And, instead of ordering
      the advance immediately, he waited, scouring the sky-line with his
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;dust&mdash;lance-heads&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three
      divisions, coming in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being on rising ground, he saw the distant relieving force much sooner
      than the rebels did, and he knew that it was help for him on the way some
      time before the first of the five gallopers careered into the camp, and
      shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cunnigan-bahadur comes with fifteen hundred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen hundred,&rdquo; muttered Byng. &ldquo;That merely serves to postpone the
      finish by an hour or two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he waited; and presently the rebel scouts brought word, and their
      leaders, too, became aware of reinforcements on the way for somebody. They
      made the mistake, though, of refusing to believe that any help could be
      coming for the British, and by the time that messengers had hurried from
      the direction of the British rear, to tell of gallopers who had ridden
      past them and been swallowed by the shouting British lines, three
      squadrons on fresh horses were close enough to be reckoned dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a gun they've got with them?&rdquo; wondered Byng. &ldquo;By the lord Harry,
      no,&mdash;it's a coach and six! They're flogging it along like a
      twelve-pounder! And what the devil's in those wagons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had no time for guesswork. The desultory thunder of the rebel
      ordnance ceased, and the whole mass that hemmed him in began to revolve
      within itself, and present a new front to the approaching cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught on the hop, by God! The whole line will advance! Trumpeter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One trumpet-call blared out and a dozen echoed it. In a second more a roar
      went up that is only heard on battle-fields. It has none of the exultant
      shout of joy or of the rage that a mob throws up to heaven; it is not even
      anger, as the cities know it, or the men who riot for advantage. It is a
      welcome ironically offered up to Death&mdash;full-throated, and more
      freighted with moral effect on an enemy than a dozen salvoes of artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thousands ahead tried hard to turn again and face two attacks at once;
      but, though the units were efficiently controlled, there were none who
      could swing the whole. Byng's decimated, forward-rushing fragment of a
      mixed brigade, tight-reined and working like a piece of mechanism, struck
      home into a mass of men who writhed, and fell away, and shouted to each
      other. A third of them was out of reach, beyond the British rear; fully
      another third was camped too far away to bring assistance at the first
      wild onslaught. Messengers were sent to bring them up, but the messengers
      were overtaken by a horde who ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, like arrows driven by the bows of death, three squadrons took them
      on the flank as Cunningham changed direction suddenly and loosed his full
      weight at the guns. Instead of standing and serving grape, the rebel
      gunners tried to get their ordnance away&mdash;facing about again too
      late, when the squadrons were almost on them. Then they died gamely, when
      gameness served no further purpose. The Rangars rode them down and
      butchered them, capturing every single gun, and leaving them while they
      charged again at the rallying hordes ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange assortment of horsed wagons and the lumbering six-horse coach
      took full advantage of the momentary confusion to make at a gallop for the
      British rear, where they drew up in line behind the Sikhs, who were
      volleying at short range in the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Byng detached two companies of British soldiers to do their amateur
      damnedest with the guns, and, for infantry, they did good service with
      them; fifteen or twenty minutes after the first onslaught the enemy was
      writhing under the withering attention of his own abandoned ordnance. But
      the odds were still tremendous, and the weight of numbers made the
      ultimate outcome of the battle seem a foregone conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the British rear heads appeared above the rising ground; the deserted
      camp was rushed and set alight. The tents blazed like a beacon light, and
      a moment later the Ghoorkas retaliated by setting fire to such of the
      rebel camp as had fallen into British hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was those two fires that saved the day. From the sky-line to the rebel
      rear came the thunder of a salvo of artillery. It was the short bark of
      twelve-pounders loaded up with blank&mdash;a signal&mdash;and the rebels
      did not wait to see whether this was friend or foe. Help from one
      unexpected source had reached the British; this, they argued, was probably
      another column moving to the relief, and they drew off in reasonably
      decent order&mdash;harried, pestered, stung, as they attempted to recover
      camp-equipment or get away with stores and wagons, by Cunningham, Alwa,
      and Mahommed Gunga.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another hour the rebel army was a black swarm spreading on the eastern
      sky-line, and on the far horizon to the north there shone the glint of
      bayonets and helmet spikes, the dancing gleam of lance-tips, and the
      dazzle from the long, polished bodies of a dozen guns. A galloper spurred
      up with a message for Byng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to join my command,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;for a raid in force on Howrah,
      where the rebels are supposed to have been concentrating for months past.
      The idea is to paralyze the vitals of the movement before concentrating
      somewhere on the road to Delhi, where the rebels are sure to make a most
      determined stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he read it Mahommed Gunga galloped up to him, grinning like a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cunnigan-sahib's respects, General-sahib! He asks leave to call his men
      off, saying that he has done all the damage possible with only fifteen
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Call 'em off and send Cunningham to me. How did he shape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a son of Cunnigan-bahadur! General-sahib-salaam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Here, you old ruffian&mdash;shake hands, will you? Now send
      Cunningham to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham came up fifteen minutes later, with a Rangar orderly behind
      him, and did his best to salute as though it were nothing more than an
      ordinary meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Here you are. 'Gratulate you, Cunningham! You came in the nick of
      time. What kept you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'ud take a long time to tell, sir. I've fifteen hundred horses about
      ten miles from here, sir, left in charge of native levies, and I'd like
      permission to go and fetch them before the levies make off with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! Yes, you'd better go for them. What's in the wagons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Howrah treasure, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole of the Howrah treasure, sir! It's held as security. Howrah
      guarantees to keep the peace and protect the homes of my men. I guaranteed
      to hand him back the treasure when the show's over, less deductions for
      damage done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm&mdash;Who thought of that? You or Mahommed Gunga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I expect we cooked it up between us, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-rrrr-umph! And what's in the six-horse coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady and her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Byng rode up to the lumbering vehicle, signing to Cunningham to follow
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Byng,&rdquo; said Cunningham. &ldquo;Miss McClean, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very much dishevelled and very weary-looking young woman with a wealth
      of chestnut hair leaned through the window and smiled, not at the General
      but at Cunningham. Byng stared&mdash;looked from one to the other of them&mdash;and
      said &ldquo;Hu-rrrr-umph!&rdquo; again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was she who made the whole thing possible, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very deuce it was!&rdquo; It began to be evident that Byng was not a
      ladies' man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. McClean, sir&mdash;Rosemary's father. He helped her put the
      whole scheme through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Byng nodded to the missionary and looked back at Rosemary McClean&mdash;then
      from her to Cunningham again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hu-rrrr-umph! Christian names already! More 'gratulations, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosemary's head and shoulders disappeared and Cunningham looked foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Send Mahommed Gunga for the horses. Ride over there to where you
      see General Evans's column and tell him the whole story. Take a small
      escort and the treasure with you. And&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;lemme see&mdash;take
      this carriage, too. Oh, by the bye&mdash;you'd better ask General Evans to
      make some arrangements for Miss McClean. Leave her over there with the
      treasure. I want you back with my brigade, and I want you to be some sort
      of use. Can't have love-making with the brigade, Mr. Cunningham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Brigadier rode off with a very perfunctory salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he a rather curmudgeony sort of officer?&rdquo; asked Rosemary the moment
      that his back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; laughed Cunningham. &ldquo;That's Byng-bahadur's little way, that's
      all. He's quite likely to insist on being best man or something of that
      sort when the show's all over! Wait here while I fetch the escort.&rdquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
